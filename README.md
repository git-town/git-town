Git Town makes software development teams who use Git even more productive and happy.
It adds Git commands that support
[GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html),
[Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow),
the [Nvie model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model),
[GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/),
and other workflows more directly,
and it allows you to perform many common Git operations faster and easier.

See [git-town.com](http://www.git-town.com) for documentation
and this [Softpedia article](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Other-Programming-Files/Git-Town.shtml)
for an independent review.


## Commands

__Git Town Configuration__

* [git town set-parent-branch](/documentation/commands/set-parent-branch.md) - updates a branch's parent


__Other Commands__

* [git town alias](/documentation/commands/alias.md) - adds or removes shorter aliases for Git Town commands

## Installation

Since version 4.0, Git Town runs natively on all platforms.
Check out our [installation instructions](http://www.git-town.com/install.html) for more details.

### Aliasing

Each command can be [aliased](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) individually to remove the `town` prefix with:
```
git config --global alias.hack 'town hack'
```

Now you can run `git hack` instead of `git town hack`.
As a convenience, you can add or remove global aliases for all `git-town` commands with:
```
git town alias <true | false>
```

## Configuration

Git Town is configured on a per-repository basis.
Upon first use in a repository, you will be prompted for the required configuration.
Use the [git town config](/documentation/commands/config.md) command to view or update your configuration at any time.

#### Required configuration

* the main development branch
* the [perennial branches](/documentation/development/branch_hierarchy.md#perennial-branches)

#### Optional Configuration

The following configuration options have defaults, so the configuration wizard does not ask about them.

* the pull branch strategy
  * how to sync the main branch / perennial branches with their upstream
  * default: `rebase`
  * possible values: `merge`, `rebase`

* the git-hack push flag
  * whether or not newly-hacked branches should be pushed to remote repo
  * default: `false`
  * possible values: `true`, `false`


## Documentation

In addition to the online documentation here,
you can run `git town` on the command line for an overview of the Git Town commands,
or `git help <command>` (e.g. `git help sync`) for help with an individual command.
