## _Git Automation for Agile Development Teams_
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/Originate/git-town" alt="Build Status" target="_blank"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/Originate/git-town.svg?branch=master"></a>

Git Town provides a number of additional Git commands that
automate the typical high-level operations in
<a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html" target="_blank">GitHub flow</a>
and others.

It is designed for workflows that have a main branch
(typically "development" or "master")
from which feature branches are cut and into which they are merged,
and assumes you use a central code repository like
<a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or
<a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">BitBucket</a>.


## commands

* [git extract](/documentation/git-extract.md) - copy selected commits from the current branch into their own branch
* [git hack](/documentation/git-hack.md) - cut a new feature branch off the main branch
* [git kill](/documentation/git-kill.md) - remove an obsolete feature branch
* [git prune-branches](/documentation/git-prune-branches.md) - delete merged branches
* [git ship](/documentation/git-ship.md) - deliver a completed feature branch
* [git sync](/documentation/git-sync.md) - update the current branch with all relevant changes
* [git sync-fork](/documentation/git-sync-fork.md) - pull upstream updates into a forked repository


#### notes

* each command only fetches the remote repository once
* automatically prunes deleted remote branches
* only pushes to the remote when the local branch is ahead


## installation

Git Town is 100% bash script, so it runs anywhere where Git and Bash runs:
OS X, Linux, BSD, and even Windows with Cygwin or something similar.
Installation on OS X can be done using <a href="http://brew.sh" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>,
other platforms need to install manually.

## configuration

On first use, Git Town will ask for the main branch name and the names of any other non feature branches.
Git Town stores its configuration in the Git configuration of your project.
If these ever need to change, the configuration can be updated using <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config" target="_blank">git config</a>.


```bash
# Read configuration
git config git-town.main-branch-name
git config git-town.non-feature-branch-names

# Write configuration
git config git-town.main-branch-name master
git config git-town.non-feature-branch-names 'qa, production'
```

## documentation

In addition to the online documentation here,
you can run `git help town` on the command line
for an overview of the git town commands,
or `git help <command>` (e.g. `git help sync`)
for help on an individual command.


## development

* run all tests: `cucumber` for normal Cucumber output or `cuke` for <a href="https://github.com/martinciu/fuubar-cucumber" target="_blank">Fuubar</a> output
  (you need to add "./bin" to your path for this to work)
* run a single test: `cucumber -n 'scenario/feature name'` or `cucumber [filename]:[lineno]`
* preview a man page: `man man/man1/git-hack.1`
