Git Town makes software development teams who use Git even more productive and happy.
It adds Git commands that support
[GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html),
[Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow),
the [Nvie model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model),
[GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/),
and other workflows more directly,
and it allows you to perform many common Git operations faster and easier.

See [git-town.com](http://www.git-town.com) for documentation.


## Commands

Git Town provides these additional Git commands:

__Development Workflow__

* [git hack](/documentation/commands/git-hack.md) - cuts a new up-to-date feature branch off the main branch
* [git sync](/documentation/commands/git-sync.md) - updates the current branch with all ongoing changes
* [git new-pull-request](/documentation/commands/git-new-pull-request.md) - create a new pull request
* [git ship](/documentation/commands/git-ship.md) - delivers a completed feature branch and removes it


__Repository Maintenance__

* [git kill](/documentation/commands/git-kill.md) - removes a feature branch
* [git prune-branches](/documentation/commands/git-prune-branches.md) - delete all merged branches
* [git rename-branch](/documentation/commands/git-rename-branch.md) - rename a branch
* [git repo](/documentation/commands/git-repo.md) - view the repository homepage


__Configuration and Help__

* [git town](/documentation/commands/git-town.md) - general Git Town help, view and change Git Town configuration


## Installation

Git Town runs anywhere Git and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html) run.
Check out our [installation instructions](http://www.git-town.com/install.html) for more details.


## Configuration

Git Town is configured on a per-repository basis. It requires two pieces of information.

* the main development branch
* the [perennial branches](/documentation/development/branch_hierarchy.md#perennial-branches)

Upon first use in a repository, you will be prompted for this information.
Use the [git town](/documentation/commands/git-town.md) command to view or update your configuration at any time.


## Documentation

In addition to the online documentation here,
you can run `git town` on the command line for an overview of the Git Town commands,
or `git help <command>` (e.g. `git help sync`) for help with an individual command.
