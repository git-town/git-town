git town repo

#### DESCRIPTION

Supported only for repositories hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/),
[GitLab](http://gitlab.com/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
When using hosted versions of GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket,
make sure that your SSH identity contains the phrase "github", "gitlab", or
 "bitbucket", so that Git Town can guess which hosting service you use.
Example: your SSH identity should be something like `git@github-as-account1:Originate/git town.git`
