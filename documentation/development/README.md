- [machine setup](setup.md)
- [run tests](testing.md)
- [work on the source code](development.md)
- [work on the website](website.md)
- [make a release](release.md)

## Architecture

- [overview](architecture.md)
- [branch hierarchy](branch_hierarchy.md): how Git Town sees branches
- [repository drivers](drivers.md): third-party specific functionality
- [step lists](steps_list.md): how most of the Git Town commands implement
