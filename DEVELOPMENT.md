# Developing the Git Town source code

This page helps you get started hacking on the Git Town codebase.

## setup

1. install [Go](https://golang.org) version 1.16
2. install [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)
   - Mac and Linux users have this out of the box
   - Windows users can install
     [Make for Windows](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or
     run `choco install make` if [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) is
     available.
3. automatically install Go-based tooling
   <code type="make/command">make setup</code>
4. manually install optional tooling: [dprint](https://dprint.dev),
   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/),
   [scc](https://github.com/boyter/scc)
5. run the tests: <code type="make/command">make test</code>
6. compile the tool: <code type="make/command">make build</code>

## dependencies

Add an external Go module:

- run `go get [dependency]` inside the Git Town folder to register the
  dependency
- use the new dependency in the code
- run `go mod vendor` to vendor it
- run `go mod tidy` to clean up

Update an external Go module:

```
go get <path>
```

Update all external Go modules:

<a type="make/command">

```
make update
```

</a>

## unit tests

Run all unit tests:

<a type="make/command">

```
make unit-all
```

</a>

Run unit tests for packages containing changes:

<a type="make/command">

```
make unit
```

</a>

Run an individual unit test:

```
go test src/cmd/root_test.go
go test src/cmd/root_test.go -v -run TestIsAcceptableGitVersion
```

## end-to-end tests

Run all end-to-end tests:

<a type="make/command">

```
make cuke
```

</a>

To run individual Cucumber tests, add a `@this` flag to the test you want to
run. Example:

```cucumber
@this
Scenario: foo bar
```

Then run:

```
make cukethis
```

Certain tests require that the Git remote points to an actual GitHub, Gitea,
GitLab or Bitbucket address. This causes `git push` operations in this test to
also go to GitHub. To prevent this, set an environment variable
`GIT_TOWN_REMOTE` with the desired value of the `origin` remote, and Git Town
will use that value instead of what is in the repo.

If Cucumber tests produce garbled output on Windows, try running them inside Git
Bash. See [this issue](https://github.com/cucumber/godog/issues/129) for
details.

## debug end-to-end tests

To see the CLI output of the shell commands in a Cucumber test, add a tag
`@debug` above the feature or scenario you want to debug:

```cucumber
@debug
Scenario: A foo walks into a bar
```

To inspect the local and remote Git repository used in an end-to-end test,
insert the step `And inspect the repo`. This step will make Cucumber print the
path of the workspace and wait until you hit ENTER. This gives you time to
inspect that folder using the tool of your choice.

Debug a Godog Cucumber feature in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com):

- open `main_test.go`
- change the path of the test to execute
- set a breakpoint in your test code
- run the `debug a test` configuration in the debugger

## run linters

Run all linters:

<a type="make/command">

```
make lint
```

</a>

Auto-fix linter errors:

<a type="make/command">

```
make fix
```

</a>

## learn about the code and test architecture

The source code contains
[Godoc comments](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/git-town/git-town) that explain
the code architecture.

## website

The source code for the [website](https://www.git-town.com) is in the
[website](website) folder. This folder contains its own
[Makefile](website/Makefile) for activities related to working on the website.
To work on the website, cd into the `website` folder and run
<code type="make/command" dir="website">make setup</code> to download the
necessary tooling and then
<code type="make/command" dir="website">make serve</code> to start a local
development server. The production site auto-updates on changes to the `main`
branch. The site hoster is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Netlify
configuration is in [netlify.toml](netlify.toml).
