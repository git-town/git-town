// Package test provides the infrastructure for the end-to-end tests.
// End-to-end tests are written in Cucumber for Go (https://github.com/cucumber/godog).
// The main file running the tests is main_test.go.
// Each test scenario gets a fully working local Git repository.
// A good starting point for learning how the end-to-end test framework provisions these repository is GitManager.
