# git abort

When a Git Town command encounters a problem, it stops and lets the user resolve
the issue. If you cannot or don't want to resolve the issue, you can run the
_abort_ command and Git Town will undo all the steps it took so far. This brings
you back to before you started the last Git Town command.
