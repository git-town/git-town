# git abort

When a Git Town command encounters a problem that it cannot resolve, for example
a merge conflict, it stops to give the user an opportunity to resolve the issue.
If you cannot or don't want to resolve the issue at this point, you can run the
_abort_ command and Git Town will undo all the steps it took so far. This brings
your repository back to how it was before you started the last Git Town command.
