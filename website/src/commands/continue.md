# git continue

When a Git Town command encounters a problem, it stops and lets the user resolve
the issue. Once you have resolved the issue, run the _continue_ command to tell
Git Town to continue executing the failed command. Git Town will retry the
failed step and execute all remaining steps of the original command.
