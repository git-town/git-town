# git continue

When a Git Town command encounters a problem that it cannot resolve, for example
a merge conflict, it stops to give the user an opportunity to resolve the issue.
Once you have resolved the issue, run the _continue_ command to tell Git Town to
continue executing the failed command. Git Town will retry the failed step and
execute all remaining steps of the original command.
