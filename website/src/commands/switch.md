# git town switch

The _switch_ command displays the branch hierarchy on your machine and allows
switching the current Git workspace to another local Git branch. Unlike
[git-switch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch), Git Town's switch command
uses an ergonomic visual UI and supports VIM motion commands.

`git town switch` does not allow switching to branches that are checked out in
other worktrees and notifies you about uncommitted changes in your workspace in
case you forgot to commit them to the current branch.

### Arguments

The `--merge` or `-m` flag has the same effect as the
[git checkout -m](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#Documentation/git-checkout.txt--m)
flag.

The `--all` or `-a` flag also displays both local and remote branches.

The `--type` or `-t` flag reduces the list of branches to those that have the
given type(s). For example, to display only observed branches:

```
git town switch --type=observed
```

Branch types can be shortened:

```
git town switch -t o
```

This can be further compacted to:

```
git town switch -to
```

You can provide multiple branch types separated by `,`, `+`, `&`, or `|`, like
this:

```
git town switch --type=observed+contribution
```

This can be shortened to:

```
git town switch -to+c
```
