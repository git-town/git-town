# git town switch

The _switch_ command displays the branch hierarchy on your machine and allows
switching the current Git workspace to another local Git branch. Unlike
[git-switch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch), Git Town's switch command
uses a more ergonomic visual UI and supports VIM motion commands.

`git town switch` notifies you about uncommitted changes in your workspace in
case you forgot to commit them to the current branch.
