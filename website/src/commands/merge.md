# git town merge

> _git town merge_

The _merge_ command merges the current branch with its parent branch and updates
proposals. Both branches must be
[feature branches](../branch-types.md#feature-branches).

### --dry-run

The `--dry-run` flag allows to test-drive this command. It prints the Git
commands that would be run but doesn't execute them.

### --verbose / -v

The `--verbose` aka `-v` flag prints all Git commands run under the hood to
determine the repository state.
