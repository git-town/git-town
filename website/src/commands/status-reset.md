# git town status reset

```command-summary
git town status reset [-v | --verbose]
```

The _status reset_ command deletes the persisted runstate. This is only needed
if the runstate is corrupted and causes Git Town to crash.

## Options

#### `-v`<br>`--verbose`

The `--verbose` aka `-v` flag prints all Git commands run under the hood to
determine the repository state.
