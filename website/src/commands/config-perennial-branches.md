# git town config perennial-branches [subcommand]

The _perennial-branches_ configuration command displays your perennial branches.
Perennial branches are long-lived branches that are never shipped. Typical
perennial branches are `main`, `master`, `development`, `production`, and
`staging`.

### Arguments

- without a subcommand, displays the currently configured perennial branches
- the `change` subcommand displays a visual dialog to set the perennial branches
