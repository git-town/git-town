# git town config perennial-branches [subcommand]

The _perennial-branches_ configuration command displays your perennial branches.
Perennial branches are long-lived branches that are never shipped. Examples for
perennial branches are `master`, `main`, `development`, `production`, or
`staging`.

### Arguments

- without a subcommand, displays the currently configured perennial branches
- the `update` subcommand displays UI to set the perennial branches
