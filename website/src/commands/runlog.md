# git town runlog

```command-summary
git town runlog [-v | --verbose]
```

Git Town records the SHA of all local and remote branches before and after each
command runs. This provides an extra layer of safety, making it easier to
manually roll back changes if git town undo doesnâ€™t fully undo the last command.

## Options

#### `-v`<br>`--verbose`

The `--verbose` aka `-v` flag prints all Git commands run under the hood to
determine the repository state.
