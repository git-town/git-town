# git town branch

```command-summary
git town branch [-v | --verbose]
```

The _branch_ command is Git Town's equivalent of the
[git branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) command. It displays the local
branch hierarchy, and the types of all branches except for main and feature
branches.

## Options

#### `-v`<br>`--verbose`

The `--verbose` aka `-v` flag prints all Git commands run under the hood to
determine the repository state.

  branch in it
- [walk](walk.md) executes a shell command or opens a shell in each of your
  local branches
