# Configuration

If your repository already contains a `.git-branches.toml` file, you are good to
go. If not or something doesn't work, run Git Town's setup assistant. It walks
you through every configuration option and give you a chance to adjust it.

```
git town config setup
```

More information about the configuration file including how to create one
manually is [here](configuration-file.md).

### Access Tokens

Setting up an API access token is super easy and multiplies Git Town's utility.
Don't skip this step.
