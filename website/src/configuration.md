# Configuration

If your repository already contains a `.git-branches.toml` file, you are good to
go. If not or something doesn't work, run Git Town's setup assistant. It walks
you through every configuration option and gives you a chance to adjust it.

```
git town config setup
```

More information about the configuration file including how to create one
manually is [here](configuration-file.md).

### Access Tokens

Setting up an API access token takes only one minute and multiplies Git Town's
utility. Make sure to set them up if possible.

- GitHub: [access token](preferences/github-token.md)
- GitLab: [access token](preferences/gitlab-token.md)
- Bitbucket: [username](preferences/bitbucket-username.md) and
  [app password](preferences/bitbucket-app-password.md)
- gitea: [access token](preferences/gitea-token.md)
