# Error handling

Sometimes Git Town commands encounter problems that require the human user to
make a decision. When this happens, the command stops and prints an error
message. When you have resolved the issue, you can either:

- run `git continue` to continue executing the interrupted command, starting
  with the operation that failed,
- run `git abort` to abort the Git Town command and go back to where you
  started.

If a Git Town command finished, you can run `git undo` to undo the changes it
made. Run `git town status` to see the status of the running Git Town command
and which Git Town commands you can run to continue, abort, or undo it.
