# Display a stack breadcrumb in pull requests

The
[Git Town GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-town-github-action)
adds a visual breadcrumb to new pull requests, showing where the branch sits in
your stack. This makes it easy for reviewers to understand the context of a PR
at a glance.
