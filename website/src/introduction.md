# High-level CLI for Git

Git Town adds Git commands that make software development more efficient by
keeping Git branches better in sync with each other. This reduces merge
conflicts and the number of Git commands you need to run.

Git is a flexible source code management system. The Git CLI (correctly)
supports all possible ways of using Git equally well. It provides basic commands
out of which Git users can implement their particular Git workflows. This
generic design can make using the Git CLI repetitive in real life. As the
screencast above demonstrates, typical development activities like creating,
synchronizing, or shipping a feature branch require running multiple, sometimes
dozens of Git commands.

Git Town adds a high-level layer of Git commands for these activities. These
commands are compatible with most common branching models like
[GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow),
[Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow),
[GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html),
[trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) and even committing
straight into the main branch. See also this
