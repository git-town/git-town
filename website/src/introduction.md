# High-level CLI for Git

Git Town solves the problem that using the Git CLI correctly is cumbersome and
repetitive, and therefore many developers don't use Git to its full potential.

Git isn't just a version control system; it's a flexible framework for creating
various version control workflows. This flexibility means that most of us end up
using ad-hoc workflows, either in our heads or through custom Bash scripts
tailored to our needs. These manual workflows often lack proper specifications
and don't handle errors and edge cases well.

Git Town is a reusable implementation of Git workflows for common usage
scenarios like contributing to a centralized code repository on platforms like
GitHub, GitLab, or Gitea. Think of Git Town as your Bash scripts for Git, but
fully engineered with rock-solid support for many use cases, edge cases, and
error conditions.

With Git Town you can keep using Git the way you do now, but with extra commands
to create various branch types, keep them in sync, compress, review, and ship
them efficiently.

Git Town is compatible with most common branching models like
[GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow),
[Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow),
[GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html),
[trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) and even committing
straight into the main branch. Git Town has special support for mono-repos and
stacked changes. See also this

  Wow <a href="https://twitter.com/GitTown">@GitTown</a> looks great, type less git commands for common branch/pr workflows.
  Similar to <a href="https://twitter.com/github">@github</a>‚Äôs ‚Äúhub‚Äù but looks more powerful, and it logs the fit commands it runs under the hood.
