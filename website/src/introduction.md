# High-level CLI for Git

Git Town adds Git commands that make software development more efficient by
keeping Git branches better in sync with each other. This reduces merge
conflicts and the number of Git commands you need to run.

Git is a flexible source code management system. It can be used in many
different ways. The Git CLI (correctly) supports all possible ways of using Git
equally well. It provides basic, generic commands out of which Git users can
implement their particular Git workflows. This generic design can make using
only the Git CLI cumbersome and repetitive in real life. As the screencast above
shows, high-level source control activities like creating, synchronizing, or
shipping a feature branch require running multiple, sometimes dozens of Git
commands.

Git Town adds a high-level layer of Git commands for typical development
operations like creating, synchronizing, or shipping feature branches. Git Town
is compatible with most common branching models like Git Flow or GitHub Flow.
