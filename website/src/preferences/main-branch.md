# main-branch

```
git-town.main-branch=<branch>
```

This setting stores the name of the main branch. The main branch is the default
parent branch for new feature branches created with
[git hack](../commands/hack.md) and the default branch into which Git Town
[ships](../commands/ship.md) finished feature branches.

Git Town automatically asks for this setting if needed. You can run the
[git town config main-branch](../commands/config-main-branch.md) command to see
or update the configured main branch.
