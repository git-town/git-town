# main-branch

```
git-town.main-branch=<branch>
```

This setting stores the name of the main branch. The main branch is the default
parent branch for new feature branches created with
[git hack](../commands/hack.md) and the default branch into which Git Town
[ships](../commands/ship.md) finished feature branches.

You can see the configured main branch via the [config](../commands/config.md)
command and change it via the [setup assistant](../commands/config-setup.md)
