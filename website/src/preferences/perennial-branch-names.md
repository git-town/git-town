The _perennial-branch-names_ setting lists the names of all perennial branches.
Perennial branches are long-lived branches. They are never shipped. Examples for
perennial branches are `master`, `main`, `development`, `production`, or
`staging`.

You can see and update the configured perennial branches via the
[git town perennial-branches](../commands/config-perennial-branches.md) command.
