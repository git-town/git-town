# parent

```
git-town-branch.<branch>.parent=<parent>
```

Git Town stores the name of the parent branch for each feature branch in Git
configuration settings of the format `git-town-branch.<branch>.parent=<parent>`.
You don't have to touch these entries. Git Town maintains them as it creates and
removes feature branches.
