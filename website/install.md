Git Town runs anywhere Git runs.

# Mac (using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh))
* Install: run `brew install git-town`
* Update: run `brew update` and then run `brew upgrade git-town`
* Uninstall: run `brew uninstall git-town`

*Note: `4.0.0` dropped support for Yosemite because we now specify a minimum Git version of 2.7.0,
which is higher than the default version installed on that OS.
If you would like to use Git Town on Yosemite,
please use the manual install and ensure your Git version is 2.7.0 or higher.*
