# git kill [&lt;branch&gt;]

The kill command deletes the currently active feature branch including all
uncommitted changes from the local and remote repository. It does not delete the
main or perennial branches.

### Customization

If you provide a branch name, `git kill` removes it instead of the currently
checked branch.
