Feature: git sync: on a feature branch (with open changes)

  As a developer syncing a feature branch
  I want my branch to be updated with changes from the tracking branch and the main branch
  So that my work stays in sync with the main development line, can be merged easily later, and I remain productive.


  Scenario: without a remote branch
    Given I have a local feature branch named "feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE              | FILE NAME          |
      | main    | local    | local main commit    | local_main_file    |
      |         | remote   | remote main commit   | remote_main_file   |
      | feature | local    | local feature commit | local_feature_file |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    And I have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted" and content: "stuff"
    When I run `git sync`
    Then it runs the Git commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                    |
      | feature | git fetch --prune          |
      | feature | git stash -u               |
      | feature | git checkout main          |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main     |
      | main    | git push                   |
      | main    | git checkout feature       |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit main   |
      | feature | git push -u origin feature |
      | feature | git stash pop              |
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
    And I still have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted" and content: "stuff"
    And all branches are now synchronized
    And I have the following commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                          | FILE NAME          |
      | main    | local and remote | remote main commit               | remote_main_file   |
      |         |                  | local main commit                | local_main_file    |
      | feature | local and remote | local feature commit             | local_feature_file |
      |         |                  | remote main commit               | remote_main_file   |
      |         |                  | local main commit                | local_main_file    |
      |         |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature |                    |

      |         | remote   | remote main commit    | remote_main_file    |
      | feature | local    | local feature commit  | local_feature_file  |
      |         | remote   | remote feature commit | remote_feature_file |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    And I have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted" and content: "stuff"
    When I run `git sync`

      | feature | git stash -u                       |
      | feature | git checkout main                  |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main             |
      | main    | git push                           |
      | main    | git checkout feature               |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit origin/feature |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit main           |
      | feature | git push                           |
