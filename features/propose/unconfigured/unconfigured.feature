Feature: ask for missing configuration

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the origin is "https://github.com/git-town/git-town.git"
    And Git Town is not configured
    When I run "git-town propose" and enter into the dialog:
      | DIALOG                | KEYS            |
      | welcome               | enter           |
      | aliases               | enter           |
      | main branch           | enter           |
      | perennial branches    |                 |
      | origin hostname       | enter           |
      | forge type            | enter           |
      | github connector type | enter           |
      | github token          | t o k e n enter |
      | token scope           | enter           |
      | enter all             | enter           |
      | config storage        | enter           |

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town prints the error:
      """
      cannot propose the main branch
      """
    And the main branch is now "main"
