Feature: ask for missing configuration

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And Git Town is not configured
    And the origin is "https://github.com/git-town/git-town.git"
    When I run "git-town propose" and enter into the dialog:
      | DIALOG                      | KEYS            |
      | welcome                     | enter           |

      | token scope                 | enter           |
      | sync feature strategy       | enter           |
      | sync perennial strategy     | enter           |

      | ship delete tracking branch | enter           |
      | config storage              | enter           |

  Scenario: result
    Then the main branch is now "main"
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      cannot propose the main branch
      """
