Feature: preserve the previous Git branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | previous | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | current  | feature | main   | local, origin |

    And tool "open" is installed
    And the origin is "https://github.com/git-town/git-town.git"

    Then the current branch is still "current"
    And the previous Git branch is still "previous"
