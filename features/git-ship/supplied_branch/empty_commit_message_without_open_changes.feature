Feature: git ship: abort shipping the given feature branch by entering an empty commit message (without open changes)

  (see ../current_branch/empty_commit_message.feature)


  Background:
    Given I have feature branches named "feature" and "other_feature"
    And the following commit exists in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE        | FILE NAME    | FILE CONTENT    |
      | feature | local    | feature commit | feature_file | feature content |
    And I am on the "other_feature" branch
    When I run `git ship feature` and enter an empty commit message


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the Git commands
      | BRANCH        | COMMAND                            |
      | other_feature | git checkout main                  |
      | main          | git fetch --prune                  |
      | main          | git rebase origin/main             |
      | main          | git checkout feature               |
      | feature       | git merge --no-edit origin/feature |
      | feature       | git merge --no-edit main           |
      | feature       | git checkout main                  |
      | main          | git merge --squash feature         |
      | main          | git commit                         |
      | main          | git reset --hard                   |
      | main          | git checkout feature               |
      | feature       | git checkout main                  |
      | main          | git checkout other_feature         |
    And I get the error "Aborting ship due to empty commit message"
    And I am still on the "other_feature" branch
    And I still have the following commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE        | FILE NAME    | FILE CONTENT    |
      | feature | local    | feature commit | feature_file | feature content |
