Feature: Prompt for parent branch when unknown

  As a developer running a command on a branch without a parent branch
  I should see a prompt asking for the information
  So the command can work as I expect


  Scenario: prompting for parent branch when running git town-append
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature-1" with no parent
    And I am on the "feature-1" branch
    When I run `git-town append feature-2` and press ENTER
    Then I end up on the "feature-2" branch
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH    | PARENT    |
      | feature-1 | main      |
      | feature-2 | feature-1 |


  Scenario: prompting for parent branch when running git town-kill
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature" with no parent
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run `git-town kill` and press ENTER
    Then I end up on the "main" branch
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES |
      | local      | main     |


  Scenario: prompting for parent branch when running git town-sync
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature" with no parent
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE        |
      | main    | local and remote | main commit    |
      | feature | local and remote | feature commit |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run `git-town sync` and press ENTER
    Then I have the following commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                          |
      | main    | local and remote | main commit                      |
      | feature | local and remote | feature commit                   |
      |         |                  | main commit                      |
      |         |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature |


  Scenario: prompting for parent branch when running git town-sync --all
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature-1" with no parent
    And I have a feature branch named "feature-2" with no parent
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION         | MESSAGE          |
      | main      | local and remote | main commit      |
      | feature-1 | local and remote | feature-1 commit |
      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit |
    And I am on the "main" branch
    When I run `git-town sync --all` and press ENTER twice
    Then I have the following commits
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                            |
      | main      | local and remote | main commit                        |
      | feature-1 | local and remote | feature-1 commit                   |
      |           |                  | main commit                        |
      |           |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature-1 |
      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit                   |
      |           |                  | main commit                        |
      |           |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature-2 |
