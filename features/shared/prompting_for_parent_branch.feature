Feature: Prompt for parent branch when unknown

  As a developer running a command on a branch without a parent branch
  I should see a prompt asking for the information
  So the command can work as I expect


  Scenario: prompting for parent branch when running git kill
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature" with no parent
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run `git kill` and press ENTER
    Then I end up on the "main" branch
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES |
      | local      | main     |


  Scenario: prompting for parent branch when running git sync
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature" with no parent
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE        |
      | main    | local and remote | main commit    |
      | feature | local and remote | feature commit |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run `git sync` and press ENTER
    Then I have the following commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                          |
      | main    | local and remote | main commit                      |
      | feature | local and remote | feature commit                   |
      |         |                  | main commit                      |
      |         |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature |


  Scenario: prompting for parent branch when running git sync --all
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature" with no parent
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE        |
      | main    | local and remote | main commit    |
      | feature | local and remote | feature commit |
    And I am on the "main" branch
    When I run `git sync --all` and press ENTER
    Then I have the following commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                          |
      | main    | local and remote | main commit                      |
      | feature | local and remote | feature commit                   |
      |         |                  | main commit                      |
      |         |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature |
