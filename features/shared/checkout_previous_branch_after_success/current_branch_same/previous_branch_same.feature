Feature: Git checkout history is preserved when the current and previous branch don't change

  As a developer running `git checkout -` after running a Git Town command
  I want to end up on the expected previous branch
  So that Git Town supports my productive use of the Git checkout history


  Scenario: git-kill
    Given I have branches named "previous", "current", and "victim"
    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
    When I run `git kill victim`
    Then I am still on the "current" branch
    And my previous Git branch is still "previous"


  Scenario: git-new-pull-request
    Given I have feature branches named "previous" and "current"
    And I have "open" installed

    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
    When I run `git new-pull-request`
    Then I am still on the "current" branch
    And my previous Git branch is still "previous"


  Scenario: git-prune-branches

      | previous | local    | previous_file | previous content |
      | current  | local    | current_file  | current content  |
    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
