Feature: deleting the current branch makes the main branch the new previous branch

  (see ./previous_branch_same.feature)


  Scenario: kill
    Given my repository has the feature branches "previous" and "current"
    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
    When I run "git-town kill previous"
    Then I am still on the "current" branch
    And the previous Git branch is now "main"


  Scenario: prune-branches
    Given my repository has the feature branches "previous" and "current"
    And the "previous" branch gets deleted on the remote
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | FILE NAME    | FILE CONTENT    |
      | current | local    | current_file | current content |
    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
    When I run "git-town prune-branches"
    Then I am still on the "current" branch
    And the previous Git branch is now "main"


  Scenario: ship
    Given my repository has the feature branches "previous" and "current"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH   | LOCATION | FILE NAME    | FILE CONTENT    |
      | previous | remote   | feature_file | feature content |
    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
    When I run "git-town ship previous -m 'feature done'"
    Then I am still on the "current" branch
    And the previous Git branch is now "main"
