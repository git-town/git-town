Feature: Git checkout history is preserved when deleting the current branch

  (see ../same_current_branch/previous_branch_same.feature)


  Scenario: kill
    Given I have feature branches named "previous" and "current"
    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
    When I run `git-town kill`
    Then I end up on the "main" branch
    And my previous Git branch is still "previous"


  Scenario: prune-branches
    Given I have feature branches named "previous" and "current"
    And the "current" branch gets deleted on the remote
    And the following commit exists in my repository
      | BRANCH   | LOCATION | FILE NAME     | FILE CONTENT     |
      | previous | local    | previous_file | previous content |
    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
    When I run `git-town prune-branches`
    Then I end up on the "main" branch
    And my previous Git branch is still "previous"


  Scenario: ship
    Given I have feature branches named "previous" and "current"
    And the following commit exists in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | FILE NAME    | FILE CONTENT    |
      | current | remote   | feature_file | feature content |
    And I am on the "current" branch with "previous" as the previous Git branch
    When I run `git-town ship -m "feature done"`
    Then I end up on the "main" branch
    And my previous Git branch is still "previous"
