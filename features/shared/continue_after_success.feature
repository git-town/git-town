Feature: continue after successful command

  Scenario Outline:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And I run "git-town <COMMAND>"
    When I run "git-town continue"
    Then Git Town prints:
      """
      nothing to continue
      """

    Examples:
      | COMMAND                 |
