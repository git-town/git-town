Feature: Show explanation when trying to continue after a successful command

  Scenario Outline:
    Given my repo has a feature branch "feature"
    And I run "git-town <COMMAND>"
    When I run "git-town continue"
    Then it prints the error:
      """
      nothing to continue
      """

    Examples:
      | COMMAND              |
      |                      |
      | alias true           |
      | append new-feature   |
      | completions fish     |
      | config               |
      | diff-parent          |
