Feature: Git Sync

  Scenario: on the main branch
    Given I am on the main branch
    And the following commits exist
      | location | message       | file name   |
      | local    | local commit  | local_file  |
      | remote   | remote commit | remote_file |
    And I have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted" and content: "stuff"
    When I run `git sync`
    Then I am still on the "main" branch
    And all branches are now synchronized
    And I have the following commits
      | branch | message       | files       |
      | main   | local commit  | local_file  |
      | main   | remote commit | remote_file |
    And now I have the following committed files
