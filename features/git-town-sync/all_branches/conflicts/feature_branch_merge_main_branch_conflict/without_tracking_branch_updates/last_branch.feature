Feature: git-town sync --all: handling merge conflicts between feature branch and main branch

  Background:
    Given my repository has the feature branches "feature-1" and "feature-2"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION         | MESSAGE          | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT      |
      | main      | remote           | main commit      | conflicting_file | main content      |
      | feature-1 | local and remote | feature-1 commit | feature1_file    | feature-1 content |
      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit | conflicting_file | feature-2 content |
    And I am on the "main" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run `git-town sync --all`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                              |
      | main      | git fetch --prune --tags             |
      |           | git add -A                           |
      |           | git stash                            |
      |           | git rebase origin/main               |
      |           | git checkout feature-1               |
      | feature-1 | git merge --no-edit origin/feature-1 |
      |           | git merge --no-edit main             |
      |           | git push                             |
      |           | git checkout feature-2               |
      | feature-2 | git merge --no-edit origin/feature-2 |
      |           | git merge --no-edit main             |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      To abort, run "git-town abort".
      To continue after having resolved conflicts, run "git-town continue".
      To continue by skipping the current branch, run "git-town skip".
      """
    And I end up on the "feature-2" branch
    And my uncommitted file is stashed
    And my repo has a merge in progress


  Scenario: aborting
    When I run `git-town abort`
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                |
      | feature-2 | git merge --abort      |
      |           | git checkout feature-1 |
      | feature-1 | git checkout main      |
      | main      | git stash pop          |
    And I end up on the "main" branch
    And my workspace has the uncommitted file again
    And my repository has the following commits
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                            | FILE NAME        |
      | main      | local and remote | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      | feature-1 | local and remote | feature-1 commit                   | feature1_file    |
      |           |                  | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      |           |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature-1 |                  |
      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit                   | conflicting_file |


  Scenario: skipping
    When I run `git-town skip`
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND           |
      | feature-2 | git merge --abort |
      |           | git checkout main |
      | main      | git push --tags   |
      |           | git stash pop     |
    And I end up on the "main" branch
    And my workspace has the uncommitted file again
    And my repository has the following commits
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                            | FILE NAME        |
      | main      | local and remote | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      | feature-1 | local and remote | feature-1 commit                   | feature1_file    |
      |           |                  | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      |           |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature-1 |                  |
      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit                   | conflicting_file |


  Scenario: continuing without resolving the conflicts
    When I run `git-town continue`
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints the error "You must resolve the conflicts before continuing"
    And I am still on the "feature-2" branch
    And my uncommitted file is stashed
    And my repo still has a merge in progress


  Scenario: continuing after resolving the conflicts
    Given I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run `git-town continue`
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND              |
      | feature-2 | git commit --no-edit |
      |           | git push             |
      |           | git checkout main    |
      | main      | git push --tags      |
      |           | git stash pop        |
    And I end up on the "main" branch
    And my workspace has the uncommitted file again
    And my repository has the following commits
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                            | FILE NAME        |
      | main      | local and remote | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      | feature-1 | local and remote | feature-1 commit                   | feature1_file    |
      |           |                  | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      |           |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature-1 |                  |
      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit                   | conflicting_file |
      |           |                  | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      |           |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature-2 |                  |


  Scenario: continuing after resolving the conflicts and committing
    Given I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run `git commit --no-edit; git-town continue`
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND           |
      | feature-2 | git push          |
      |           | git checkout main |
      | main      | git push --tags   |
      |           | git stash pop     |
    And I end up on the "main" branch
    And my workspace has the uncommitted file again
    And my repository has the following commits
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                            | FILE NAME        |
      | main      | local and remote | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      | feature-1 | local and remote | feature-1 commit                   | feature1_file    |
      |           |                  | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      |           |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature-1 |                  |
      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit                   | conflicting_file |
      |           |                  | main commit                        | conflicting_file |
      |           |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature-2 |                  |
