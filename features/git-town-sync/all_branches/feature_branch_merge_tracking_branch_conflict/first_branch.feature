Feature: git-town sync --all: handling merge conflicts between feature branch and its tracking branch

  Background:
    Given I have feature branches named "feature-1" and "feature-2"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                 | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT             |
      | main      | remote           | main commit             | main_file        | main content             |
      | feature-1 | local            | feature-1 local commit  | conflicting_file | feature-1 local content  |
      |           | remote           | feature-1 remote commit | conflicting_file | feature-1 remote content |
      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit        | feature2_file    | feature-2 content        |
    And I am on the "main" branch
    And I have an uncommitted file
    When I run `git-town sync --all`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                              |
      | main      | git fetch --prune                    |
      |           | git add -A                           |
      |           | git stash                            |
      |           | git rebase origin/main               |
      |           | git checkout feature-1               |
      | feature-1 | git merge --no-edit origin/feature-1 |
    And I get the error
      """
      To abort, run "git-town sync --abort".
      To continue after you have resolved the conflicts, run "git-town sync --continue".
      To skip the sync of the 'feature-1' branch, run "git-town sync --skip".
      """
    And I end up on the "feature-1" branch
    And my uncommitted file is stashed
    And my repo has a merge in progress


  Scenario: aborting
    When I run `git-town sync --abort`
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND           |
      | feature-1 | git merge --abort |
      |           | git checkout main |
      | main      | git stash pop     |
    And I end up on the "main" branch
    And I again have my uncommitted file
    And I have the following commits

      | feature-2 | local and remote | feature-2 commit        | feature2_file    |


  Scenario: skipping
    When I run `git-town sync --skip`
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                              |
      | feature-1 | git merge --abort                    |
      |           | git checkout feature-2               |
      | feature-2 | git merge --no-edit origin/feature-2 |

  Scenario: continuing without resolving the conflicts
    When I run `git-town sync --continue`
    Then it runs no commands
    And I get the error "You must resolve the conflicts before continuing"
    And I am still on the "feature-1" branch
    And my uncommitted file is stashed
    And my repo still has a merge in progress


  Scenario: continuing after resolving the conflicts
    Given I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run `git-town sync --continue`

  Scenario: continuing after resolving the conflicts and committing
    Given I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run `git commit --no-edit; git-town sync --continue`
    Then it runs the commands
