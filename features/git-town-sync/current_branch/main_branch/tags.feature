Feature: git-town sync: syncing the main branch syncs the tags

  As a developer using Git tags for release management
  I want my tags to be published whenever I sync my main branch
  So that I can do tagging work effectively on my local machine.


  Background:
    Given I have the following tags
      | NAME       | LOCATION |
      | local-tag  | local    |
      | remote-tag | remote   |
    And I am on the "main" branch
    When I run `git-town sync`


  Scenario: result
    Then I now have the following tags
      | NAME       | LOCATION         |
      | local-tag  | local and remote |
      | remote-tag | local and remote |
