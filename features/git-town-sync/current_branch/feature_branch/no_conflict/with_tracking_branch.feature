Feature: git-town sync: syncing the current feature branch with a tracking branch

  As a developer syncing a feature branch
  I want my branch to be updated with changes from the tracking branch and the main branch
  So that my work stays in sync with the main development line, can be merged easily later, and I remain productive.


  Background:
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE               | FILE NAME           |
      | main    | local    | local main commit     | local_main_file     |
      |         | remote   | remote main commit    | remote_main_file    |
      | feature | local    | local feature commit  | local_feature_file  |
      |         | remote   | remote feature commit | remote_feature_file |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    And I have an uncommitted file
    When I run `git-town sync`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                            |
      | feature | git fetch --prune                  |
      |         | git add -A                         |
      |         | git stash                          |
      |         | git checkout main                  |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main             |
      |         | git push                           |
      |         | git checkout feature               |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit origin/feature |
      |         | git merge --no-edit main           |
      |         | git push                           |
      |         | git stash pop                      |
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
    And I still have my uncommitted file
    And I have the following commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                                                    | FILE NAME           |
      | main    | local and remote | remote main commit                                         | remote_main_file    |
      |         |                  | local main commit                                          | local_main_file     |
      | feature | local and remote | local feature commit                                       | local_feature_file  |
      |         |                  | remote feature commit                                      | remote_feature_file |
      |         |                  | Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/feature' into feature |                     |
      |         |                  | remote main commit                                         | remote_main_file    |
      |         |                  | local main commit                                          | local_main_file     |
      |         |                  | Merge branch 'main' into feature                           |                     |
