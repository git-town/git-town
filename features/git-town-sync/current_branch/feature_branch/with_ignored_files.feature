Feature: syncing with ignored files

  As a developer using an IDE that creates a temp folder I don't want to check in
  I want "git-town sync" to leave those ignored files alone
  So that my IDE settings are not deleted while developing.

  - all files ignored by Git survive a "git sync" process unchanged


  Scenario: running "git sync" with ignored files
    Given my repo ignores files named "ignored"
    And I have a feature branch named "feature"
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    And I have an uncommitted file with name: "somefile" and content: "important"
    And I have an uncommitted file with name: "test/ignored/important" and content: "very important"
    When I run `git-town sync`
    Then my workspace still contains the file "test/ignored/important" with content "very important"
