Feature: git-repo when origin is on GitLab

  Scenario Outline: result
    Given my repo's origin is "<ORIGIN>"
    And my computer has the "open" tool installed
    When I run "git-town repo"
    Then "open" launches a new pull request with this url in my browser:
      """
      https://gitlab.com/kadu/kadu
      """

    Examples:
      | ORIGIN                           |
      | https://gitlab.com/kadu/kadu.git |
      | git@gitlab.com:kadu/kadu.git     |
