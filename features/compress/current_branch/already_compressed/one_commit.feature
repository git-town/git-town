Feature: does not compress already compressed branches

  Background:
    Given a Git repo clone
    And the branch
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the current branch is "feature"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE  | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT |
      | feature | local, origin | commit 1 | file_1    | content 1    |
    When I run "git-town compress"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                  |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      branch "feature" has already just one commit
      """
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the initial commits exist
    And the initial branches and lineage exist

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs no commands
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the initial commits exist
    And the initial branches and lineage exist
