Feature: Accepting all default values leads to a working setup

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME       | TYPE   | LOCATIONS     |
      | dev        | (none) | local, origin |
      | production | (none) | local, origin |
    And local Git setting "init.defaultbranch" is "main"
    And Git Town is not configured
    When I run "git-town init" and enter into the dialogs:
      | DIALOG             | KEYS       |
      | welcome            | enter      |
      | aliases            | enter      |
      | main branch        | enter      |
      | perennial branches | enter      |
      | origin hostname    | enter      |
      | forge type         | enter      |
      | enter all          | enter      |
      | config storage     | down enter |

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And local Git setting "git-town.dev-remote" still doesn't exist

    And local Git setting "git-town.main-branch" still doesn't exist

    And local Git setting "git-town.ship-delete-tracking-branch" still doesn't exist
    And the configuration file is now:

      # See https://www.git-town.com/configuration-file for details

      [branches]
      main = "main"
      """
    And the main branch is still not set
    And there are still no perennial branches
