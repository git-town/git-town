Feature: Accepting all default values leads to a working setup

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME       | TYPE   | LOCATIONS     |
      | dev        | (none) | local, origin |
      | production | (none) | local, origin |
    And Git Town is not configured
    And local Git setting "init.defaultbranch" is "main"
    When I run "git-town init" and enter into the dialogs:
      | DIALOG                      | KEYS       |
      | welcome                     | enter      |
      | aliases                     | enter      |

      | config storage              | enter      |

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | COMMAND                                              |
      | git config git-town.auto-sync true                   |
      | git config git-town.detached false                   |

      | git config git-town.main-branch main                 |

      | git config git-town.push-branches true               |
      | git config git-town.push-hook true                   |
      | git config git-town.share-new-branches no            |
      | git config git-town.ship-strategy api                |
      | git config git-town.ship-delete-tracking-branch true |
      | git config git-town.stash true                       |
      | git config git-town.sync-feature-strategy merge      |

      | git config git-town.sync-tags true                   |
    And there are still no perennial branches
