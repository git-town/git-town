Feature: git town-rename-branch: errors if renaming a feature branch that has unpulled changes

  As a developer renaming a feature branch that has unpulled changes
  I should get an error that the given branch is not in sync with its tracking branch
  So that I don't lose work by deleting branches that contain commits that haven't been pulled yet.


  Background:
    Given my repository has a feature branch named "current-feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH          | LOCATION      | MESSAGE               |
      | main            | local, remote | main commit           |
      | current-feature | local, remote | feature commit        |
      |                 | remote        | remote feature commit |
    And I am on the "current-feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town rename-branch current-feature renamed-feature"


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH          | COMMAND                  |
      | current-feature | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      'current-feature' is not in sync with its tracking branch. Please sync the branches before renaming.
      """
    And I end up on the "current-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And my repository is left with my original commits
