Feature: git town-ship: errors when trying to ship the main branch

  (see ../current_branch/on_main_branch.feature)


  Background:
    Given my repository has a feature branch named "feature"
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town ship main"


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                  |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      The branch 'main' is not a feature branch. Only feature branches can be shipped.
      """
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
