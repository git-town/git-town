Feature: git kill: killing the given feature branch when on it (without open changes or remote repo)

  (see ../with_tracking_branch/with_open_changes.feature)


  Background:
    Given my repo does not have a remote origin
    And I have local feature branches named "current-feature" and "other-feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH          | LOCATION | MESSAGE                | FILE NAME            | FILE CONTENT            |
      | current-feature | local    | current feature commit | current_feature_file | current feature content |
      | other-feature   | local    | other feature commit   | other_feature_file   | other feature content   |
    And I am on the "current-feature" branch
    When I run `git kill current-feature`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the Git commands
      | BRANCH          | COMMAND                       |
      | current-feature | git checkout main             |
      | main            | git branch -D current-feature |
    And I end up on the "main" branch
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES            |
      | local      | main, other-feature |
    And now I have the following commits
      | BRANCH        | LOCATION | MESSAGE              | FILE NAME          |
      | other-feature | local    | other feature commit | other_feature_file |
    And now I have the following committed files
      | BRANCH        | NAME               | CONTENT               |
      | other-feature | other_feature_file | other feature content |


  Scenario: undoing the kill
    When I run `git kill --undo`
    Then it runs the Git commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                                                        |
      | main   | git branch current-feature <%= sha 'current feature commit' %> |
      |        | git checkout current-feature                                   |
    And I end up on the "current-feature" branch
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES                             |
      | local      | main, current-feature, other-feature |
    And now I have the following commits
      | BRANCH          | LOCATION | MESSAGE                | FILE NAME            |
      | current-feature | local    | current feature commit | current_feature_file |
      | other-feature   | local    | other feature commit   | other_feature_file   |
    And now I have the following committed files
      | BRANCH          | NAME                 | CONTENT                 |
      | current-feature | current_feature_file | current feature content |
      | other-feature   | other_feature_file   | other feature content   |
