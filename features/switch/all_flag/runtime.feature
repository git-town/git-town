Feature: switch to a new remote branch while enabling to show all branches at runtime

  Scenario: enable using 'a' key
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | local-1  | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | local-2  | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | remote-1 | feature | main   | origin        |
    And the current branch is "local-2"
    And I ran "git fetch"
    When I run "git-town switch" and enter into the dialogs:
      | DIALOG        | KEYS       |
      | switch-branch | a up enter |
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND               |
      | local-2 | git checkout remote-1 |
