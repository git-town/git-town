Feature: abort the ship via empty commit message

  Background:
    Given my repo has the feature branches "feature" and "other"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT    |
      | main    | local, origin | main commit    | main_file        | main content    |
      | feature | local         | feature commit | conflicting_file | feature content |
    And I am on the "other" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file with name "conflicting_file" and content "conflicting content"
    When I run "git-town ship feature" and enter an empty commit message

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                     |
      | other   | git fetch --prune --tags                    |
      |         | git add -A                                  |
      |         | git stash                                   |
      |         | git checkout main                           |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main                      |
      |         | git checkout feature                        |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit origin/feature          |
      |         | git merge --no-edit main                    |
      |         | git checkout main                           |
      | main    | git merge --squash feature                  |
      |         | git commit                                  |
      |         | git reset --hard                            |
      |         | git checkout feature                        |
      | feature | git reset --hard {{ sha 'feature commit' }} |
      |         | git checkout main                           |
      | main    | git checkout other                          |
      | other   | git stash pop                               |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      aborted because commit exited with error
      """
    And I am still on the "other" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And now the initial commits exist
    And Git Town is still aware of the initial branch hierarchy

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints the error:
      """
      nothing to undo
      """
    And I am still on the "other" branch
    And now these commits exist
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        |
      | main    | local, origin | main commit    |
      | feature | local         | feature commit |
    And Git Town is still aware of the initial branch hierarchy
