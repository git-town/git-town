Feature: abort the ship via empty commit message

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS |
      | feature | feature | main   | local     |
      | other   | feature | main   | local     |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT    |
      | main    | local, origin | main commit    | main_file        | main content    |
      | feature | local         | feature commit | conflicting_file | feature content |
    And the current branch is "other"
    And Git setting "git-town.ship-strategy" is "squash-merge"
    When I run "git-town ship feature" and enter an empty commit message

  @skipWindows
  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                         |
      | other  | git fetch --prune --tags        |
      |        | git checkout main               |
      | main   | git merge --squash --ff feature |
      |        | git commit                      |
      |        | git reset --hard                |
      |        | git checkout other              |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      aborted because merge exited with error
      """
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial lineage exists now
  #
  # NOTE: Cannot test undo here.
  # The Git Town command under test has not created an undoable runstate.
  # Executing "git town undo" would undo the Git Town command executed during setup.
