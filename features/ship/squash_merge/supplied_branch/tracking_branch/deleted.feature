Feature: branch was deleted at the remote

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | other   | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        | FILE NAME        |
      | feature | local, origin | feature commit | conflicting_file |
    And Git setting "git-town.ship-strategy" is "squash-merge"
    And origin deletes the "feature" branch
    And the current branch is "other"
    When I run "git-town ship feature" and enter "feature done" for the commit message

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | other  | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      branch feature was deleted at the remote
      """
  #
  # NOTE: Cannot test undo here.
  # The Git Town command under test has not created an undoable runstate.
  # Executing "git town undo" would undo the Git Town command executed during setup.
