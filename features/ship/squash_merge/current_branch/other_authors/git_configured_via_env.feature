Feature: ship a coworker's feature branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And Git Town is not configured
    And local Git setting "git-town.main-branch" is "main"
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE          | AUTHOR                            |
      | feature | local, origin | developer commit | developer <developer@example.com> |
      |         |               | coworker commit  | coworker <coworker@example.com>   |
    And Git setting "git-town.ship-strategy" is "squash-merge"
    And the current branch is "feature"

  Scenario: choose the account configured by the GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL env variables
    When I run "git-town ship -m 'feature done'" with the environment variables "GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=developer" and "GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=developer@example.com" and enter into the dialog:
      | DIALOG               | KEYS       |
      | squash commit author | down enter |
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                         |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags        |
      |         | git checkout main               |
      | main    | git merge --squash --ff feature |
      |         | git commit -m "feature done"    |
      |         | git push                        |
      |         | git push origin :feature        |
      |         | git branch -D feature           |
    And no lineage exists now
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      | AUTHOR                            |
      | main   | local, origin | feature done | developer <developer@example.com> |

  Scenario: choose the account configured by the GIT_COMMITTER_NAME and GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL env variables
    When I run "git-town ship -m 'feature done'" with the environment variables "GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=developer" and "GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=developer@example.com" and enter into the dialog:
      | DIALOG               | KEYS       |
      | squash commit author | down enter |
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                         |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags        |
      |         | git checkout main               |
      | main    | git merge --squash --ff feature |
      |         | git commit -m "feature done"    |
      |         | git push                        |
      |         | git push origin :feature        |
      |         | git branch -D feature           |
    And no lineage exists now
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      | AUTHOR                   |
      | main   | local, origin | feature done | user <email@example.com> |
