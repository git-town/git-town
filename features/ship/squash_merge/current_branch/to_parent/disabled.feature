Feature: does not ship a child branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME  | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | alpha | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | beta  | feature | alpha  | local, origin |
      | gamma | feature | beta   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      |
      | alpha  | local, origin | alpha commit |
      | beta   | local, origin | beta commit  |
      | gamma  | local, origin | gamma commit |
    And Git Town setting "ship-strategy" is "squash-merge"
    And the current branch is "gamma"
    When I run "git-town ship"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | gamma  | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      shipping this branch would ship "alpha" and "beta" as well,
      please ship "alpha" first
      """
    And the current branch is still "gamma"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And Git Town prints:
      """
      nothing to undo
      """
    And the current branch is still "gamma"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
