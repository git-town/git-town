Feature: git town-ship: shipping the current feature branch

  As a developer entering a commit message that contains a double quote
  I want it to still work as expected
  So shipping is a robust process.


  Background:
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature"
    And the following commit exists in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE        | FILE NAME    | FILE CONTENT    |
      | feature | local and remote | feature commit | feature_file | feature content |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run `git-town ship -m 'message containing "double quotes"'`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                                |
      | feature | git fetch --prune                                      |
      |         | git checkout main                                      |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main                                 |
      |         | git checkout feature                                   |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit origin/feature                     |
      |         | git merge --no-edit main                               |
      |         | git checkout main                                      |
      | main    | git merge --squash feature                             |
      |         | git commit -m "message containing \\"double quotes\\"" |
      |         | git push                                               |
      |         | git push origin :feature                               |
      |         | git branch -D feature                                  |
    And I end up on the "main" branch
    And there are no more feature branches
    And there are no open changes
    And I have the following commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                            | FILE NAME    |
      | main   | local and remote | message containing "double quotes" | feature_file |


  Scenario: undo
    When I run `git-town ship --undo`
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                                    |
      | main    | git branch feature <%= sha 'feature commit' %>             |
      |         | git push -u origin feature                                 |
      |         | git revert <%= sha 'message containing "double quotes"' %> |
      |         | git push                                                   |
      |         | git checkout feature                                       |
      | feature | git checkout main                                          |
      | main    | git checkout feature                                       |
    And I end up on the "feature" branch
    And I have the following commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                                     | FILE NAME    |
      | main    | local and remote | message containing "double quotes"          | feature_file |
      |         |                  | Revert "message containing "double quotes"" | feature_file |
      | feature | local and remote | feature commit                              | feature_file |
