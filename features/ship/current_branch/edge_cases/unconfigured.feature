Feature: ask for missing configuration information

  Scenario: running unconfigured
    Given I haven't configured Git Town yet
    When I run "git-town ship" and answer the prompts:
      | PROMPT                                     | ANSWER  |
      | Please specify the main development branch | [ENTER] |
    Then it prints the initial configuration prompt
    And the main branch is now configured as "main"
    And my repo is now configured with no perennial branches
    And it prints the error:
      """
      the branch "main" is not a feature branch. Only feature branches can be shipped
      """
