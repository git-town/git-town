Feature: handle conflicts between the shipped branch and its tracking branch

  Background:
    Given my repo has a feature branch "feature"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE                   | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT   |
      | feature | local    | conflicting local commit  | conflicting_file | local content  |
      |         | remote   | conflicting remote commit | conflicting_file | remote content |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run "git-town ship -m 'feature done'"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                            |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags           |
      |         | git checkout main                  |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main             |
      |         | git checkout feature               |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit origin/feature |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      To abort, run "git-town abort".
      To continue after having resolved conflicts, run "git-town continue".
      """
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
    And my repo now has a merge in progress

  Scenario: abort
    When I run "git-town abort"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND              |
      | feature | git merge --abort    |
      |         | git checkout main    |
      | main    | git checkout feature |
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
    And there is no merge in progress
    And my repo is left with my initial commits
    And Git Town still knows the initial branch hierarchy

  Scenario: resolve and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git-town continue"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                      |
      | feature | git commit --no-edit         |
      |         | git merge --no-edit main     |
      |         | git checkout main            |
      | main    | git merge --squash feature   |
      |         | git commit -m "feature done" |
      |         | git push                     |
      |         | git push origin :feature     |
      |         | git branch -D feature        |
    And I am now on the "main" branch
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES |
      | local, remote | main     |
    And my repo now has the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      | FILE NAME        |
      | main   | local, remote | feature done | conflicting_file |
    And Git Town is now aware of no branch hierarchy

  Scenario: resolve, commit, and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git commit --no-edit"
    And I run "git-town continue"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                      |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit main     |
      |         | git checkout main            |
      | main    | git merge --squash feature   |
      |         | git commit -m "feature done" |
      |         | git push                     |
      |         | git push origin :feature     |
      |         | git branch -D feature        |
    And I am now on the "main" branch
