Feature: enter the commit message interactively via the editor

  Background:
    Given the current branch is a feature branch "feature"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        |
      | feature | local, origin | feature commit |
    When I run "git-town ship --dry-run" and enter "feature done" for the commit message

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                         |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags        |
      |         | git checkout main               |
      | main    | git merge --squash --ff feature |
      |         | git commit                      |
      |         | git push origin :feature        |
      |         | git branch -D feature           |
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the initial commits exist
    And the initial branches and lineage exist

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs no commands
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the initial commits exist
    And the initial branches and lineage exist
