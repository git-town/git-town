Feature: does not ship out-of-sync branches

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE                |
      | feature | local    | unsynced local commit  |
      |         | origin   | unsynced origin commit |
    And the current branch is "feature"
    And Git Town setting "ship-strategy" is "fast-forward"
    When I run "git-town ship"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                  |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      branch "feature" is not in sync
      """

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And no merge is in progress
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial lineage exists now
