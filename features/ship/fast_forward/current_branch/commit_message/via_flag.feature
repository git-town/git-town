Feature: ship a branch via the fast-forward strategy

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        |
      | feature | local, origin | feature commit |
    And the current branch is "feature"
    And Git Town setting "ship-strategy" is "fast-forward"
    When I run "git-town ship -m done"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                  |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      shipping with the fast-forward strategy does not use the given commit message
      """
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
    And the initial commits exist now

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
    And the initial commits exist now
