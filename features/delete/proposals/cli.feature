Feature: delete the current feature branch from a stack and update proposals

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the origin is "git@github.com:git-town/git-town.git"
    And the branches
      | NAME   | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | alpha  | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | beta   | feature | alpha  | local, origin |
      | gamma1 | feature | beta   | local, origin |
      | gamma2 | feature | beta   | local, origin |
      | delta  | feature | gamma2 | local, origin |
    And the proposals
      | ID | SOURCE BRANCH | TARGET BRANCH | BODY        | URL                      |
      |  1 | alpha         | main          | alpha body  | https://example.com/pr/1 |
      |  2 | beta          | alpha         | beta body   | https://example.com/pr/2 |
      |  3 | gamma1        | beta          | gamma1 body | https://example.com/pr/3 |
      |  4 | gamma2        | beta          | gamma2 body | https://example.com/pr/4 |
      |  5 | delta         | gamma2        | delta body  | https://example.com/pr/5 |
    And Git setting "git-town.proposals-show-lineage" is "cli"
    And the current branch is "beta"
    When I run "git-town delete"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
