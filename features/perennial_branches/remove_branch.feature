  Scenario: removing a branch that is a perennial branch
    When I run "git-town perennial-branches update" and answer the prompts:
      | PROMPT                            | ANSWER               |
      | Please specify perennial branches | [DOWN][SPACE][ENTER] |
    Then the perennial branches are now configured as "qa"
