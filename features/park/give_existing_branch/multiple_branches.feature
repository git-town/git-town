Feature: parking multiple other branches

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME         | TYPE         | PARENT | LOCATIONS |
      | feature      | feature      | main   | local     |
      | contribution | contribution |        | local     |
      | observed     | observed     | main   | local     |
      | prototype    | prototype    | main   | local     |
    When I run "git-town park feature contribution observed prototype"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints:
      """
      branch "feature" is now parked
      """
    And branch "feature" is now parked
    And branch "contribution" is now parked
    And there are now no contribution branches
    And branch "observed" is now parked
    And there are now no observed branches
    And branch "prototype" is now parked
    And branch "prototype" is still prototype
    And the current branch is still "main"

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs no commands
    And there are now no parked branches
    And the current branch is still "main"
