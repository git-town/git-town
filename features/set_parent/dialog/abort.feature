Feature: abort the dialog

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME   | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | parent | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | child  | feature | parent | local, origin |
    And the current branch is "child"
    When I run "git-town set-parent" and enter into the dialog:
      | DIALOG                    | KEYS |
      | parent branch for "child" | esc  |

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
    And the initial commits exist now
  #
  # NOTE: Cannot test undo here.
  # The Git Town command under test has not created an undoable runstate.
  # Executing "git town undo" would undo the Git Town command executed during setup.
