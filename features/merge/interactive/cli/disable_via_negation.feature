  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME  | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | alpha | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      | FILE NAME  | FILE CONTENT  |

    And Git Town is not configured
    And the current branch is "beta"
    When I run "git-town merge --non-interactive"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | beta   | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      no main branch configured and interactivity disabled via CLI.

      To configure:
      git config git-town.main-branch <branch>
      """
