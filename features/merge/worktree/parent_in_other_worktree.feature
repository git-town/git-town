Feature: merging a branch whose parent is active in another worktree

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME  | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | alpha | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      | FILE NAME  | FILE CONTENT  |
      | alpha  | local, origin | alpha commit | alpha-file | alpha content |
    And the branches
      | NAME | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | beta | feature | alpha  | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT |
      | beta   | local, origin | beta commit | beta-file | beta content |
    And the current branch is "beta"
    And branch "alpha" is active in another worktree
    When I run "git-town merge"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | beta   | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      branch "alpha" is active in another worktree
      """
    And the initial lineage exists now
    And the initial commits exist now
  #
  # NOTE: Cannot test undo here.
  # The Git Town command under test has not created an undoable runstate.
  # Executing "git town undo" would undo the Git Town command executed during setup.
