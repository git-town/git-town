Feature: git town-prepend: errors when trying to prepend something in front of the main branch

  As a developer accidentally trying to prepend someting in front of the main branch
  I should see an error that the main branch has no parents
  So that I know about my mistake and run "git hack" instead.


  Background:
    Given I have perennial branches named "qa" and "production"
    And I am on the "production" branch
    When I run `git-town prepend new-parent`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH     | COMMAND           |
      | production | git fetch --prune |
    And I get the error "The branch 'production' is not a feature branch. Only feature branches can have parent branches."
    And I am still on the "production" branch
    And there are no commits
    And there are no open changes
