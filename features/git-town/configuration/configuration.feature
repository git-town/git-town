Feature: listing the configuration

  As a user unsure about how Git Town is currently configured
  I want to be able to see the complete Git Town configuration with one command
  So that I can configure Git Town efficiently, and have more time for actual work.


  Scenario: everything is configured
    Given I have configured the main branch name as "main"
    And my non-feature branches are configured as "qa" and "staging"
    When I run `git town config`
    Then I see
      """
      Main branch: main
      Non-feature branches:
      qa
      staging
      """


  Scenario: the main branch is configured but the non-feature branches are not
    Given I have configured the main branch name as "main"
    And my non-feature branches are not configured
    When I run `git town config`
    Then I see
      """
      Main branch: main
      Non-feature branches: [none]
      """


  Scenario: the main branch is not configured but the non-feature branches are
    Given I don't have a main branch name configured
    And my non-feature branches are configured as "qa" and "staging"
    When I run `git town config`
    Then I see
      """
      Main branch: [none]
      Non-feature branches:
      qa
      staging
      """


  Scenario: nothing is configured yet
    Given I haven't configured Git Town yet
    When I run `git town config`
    Then I see
      """
      Main branch: [none]
      Non-feature branches: [none]
      """
