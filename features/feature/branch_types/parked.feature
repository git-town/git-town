Feature: make a parked branch a feature branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE   | PARENT | LOCATIONS |
      | existing | parked | main   | local     |
    And the current branch is "main"
    When I run "git-town feature existing"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And Git Town prints:
      """
      branch "existing" is now a feature branch
      """
    And branch "existing" now has type "feature"
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And branch "existing" now has type "parked"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
