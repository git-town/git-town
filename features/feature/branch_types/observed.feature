Feature: make an observed branch a feature branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE     | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | existing | observed | main   | local, origin |
    And the current branch is "main"
    When I run "git-town feature existing"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And Git Town prints:
      """
      branch "existing" is now a feature branch
      """
    And branch "existing" now has type "feature"
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And branch "existing" now has type "observed"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
