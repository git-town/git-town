Feature: git town-kill: killing the given feature branch

  As a developer working on something
  I want to be able to cleanly delete another dead-end feature branch without leaving my ongoing work
  So that I keep the repository lean and my team's productivity remains high.


  Background:
    Given I have feature branches named "good-feature" and "dead-feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH       | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                              | FILE NAME        |
      | main         | local and remote | conflicting with uncommitted changes | conflicting_file |
      | dead-feature | local and remote | dead-end commit                      | unfortunate_file |
      | good-feature | local and remote | good commit                          | good_file        |
    And I am on the "good-feature" branch
    And I have an uncommitted file with name: "conflicting_file" and content: "conflicting content"
    When I run `git-town kill dead-feature`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH       | COMMAND                       |
      | good-feature | git fetch --prune             |
      |              | git add -A                    |
      |              | git stash                     |
      |              | git push origin :dead-feature |
      |              | git branch -D dead-feature    |
      |              | git stash pop                 |
    And I am still on the "good-feature" branch
    And I still have my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES           |
      | local      | main, good-feature |
      | remote     | main, good-feature |
    And I have the following commits
      | BRANCH       | LOCATION         | MESSAGE                              | FILE NAME        |
      | main         | local and remote | conflicting with uncommitted changes | conflicting_file |
      | good-feature | local and remote | good commit                          | good_file        |


  Scenario: undoing the kill
    When I run `git-town kill --undo`
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH       | COMMAND                                              |
      | good-feature | git add -A                                           |
      |              | git stash                                            |
      |              | git branch dead-feature <%= sha 'dead-end commit' %> |
      |              | git push -u origin dead-feature                      |
      |              | git stash pop                                        |
    And I am still on the "good-feature" branch
    And I still have my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES                         |
      | local      | main, dead-feature, good-feature |
      | remote     | main, dead-feature, good-feature |
    And I am left with my original commits
