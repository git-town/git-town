Feature: git town-kill: killing the given feature branch

  As a developer working on something
  I want to be able to cleanly delete another dead-end feature branch without leaving my ongoing work
  So that I keep the repository lean and my team's productivity remains high.


  Background:
    Given my repository has the feature branches "good-feature" and "dead-feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH       | LOCATION      | MESSAGE                              | FILE NAME        |
      | main         | local, remote | conflicting with uncommitted changes | conflicting_file |
      | dead-feature | local, remote | dead-end commit                      | unfortunate_file |
      | good-feature | local, remote | good commit                          | good_file        |
    And I am on the "good-feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file with name: "conflicting_file" and content: "conflicting content"
    When I run "git-town kill dead-feature"


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH       | COMMAND                       |
      | good-feature | git fetch --prune --tags      |
      |              | git push origin :dead-feature |
      |              | git branch -D dead-feature    |
    And I am still on the "good-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES           |
      | local      | main, good-feature |
      | remote     | main, good-feature |
    And my repository now has the following commits
      | BRANCH       | LOCATION      | MESSAGE                              | FILE NAME        |
      | main         | local, remote | conflicting with uncommitted changes | conflicting_file |
      | good-feature | local, remote | good commit                          | good_file        |


  Scenario: undoing the kill
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH       | COMMAND                                             |
      | good-feature | git branch dead-feature {{ sha 'dead-end commit' }} |
      |              | git push -u origin dead-feature                     |
    And I am still on the "good-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES                         |
      | local      | main, dead-feature, good-feature |
      | remote     | main, dead-feature, good-feature |
    And my repository is left with my original commits
