Feature: renaming a perennial branch with a tracking branch

  Background:
    Given my repo has the perennial branches "qa" and "production"
    And my repo has a feature branch "child-feature" as a child of "production"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH        | LOCATION      | MESSAGE              |
      | child-feature | local, remote | child feature commit |
      | production    | local, remote | production commit    |
    And I am on the "production" branch

  Scenario: normal rename fails
    When I run "git-town rename-branch production renamed-production"
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints the error:
      """
      "production" is a perennial branch. Renaming a perennial branch typically requires other updates. If you are sure you want to do this, use '--force'
      """

  Scenario: forced rename works
    When I run "git-town rename-branch --force production renamed-production"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH             | COMMAND                                  |
      | production         | git fetch --prune --tags                 |
      |                    | git branch renamed-production production |
      |                    | git checkout renamed-production          |
      | renamed-production | git push -u origin renamed-production    |
      |                    | git push origin :production              |
      |                    | git branch -D production                 |
    And I am now on the "renamed-production" branch
    And the perennial branches are now "qa" and "renamed-production"
    And my repo now has the following commits
      | BRANCH             | LOCATION      | MESSAGE              |
      | child-feature      | local, remote | child feature commit |
      | renamed-production | local, remote | production commit    |
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH        | PARENT             |
      | child-feature | renamed-production |

  Scenario: undo the forced rename
    Given I ran "git-town rename-branch --force production renamed-production"
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH             | COMMAND                                             |
      | renamed-production | git branch production {{ sha 'production commit' }} |
      |                    | git push -u origin production                       |
      |                    | git push origin :renamed-production                 |
      |                    | git checkout production                             |
      | production         | git branch -D renamed-production                    |
    And I am now on the "production" branch
    And the perennial branches are now "qa" and "production"
    And my repo is left with my original commits
    And Git Town now has the original branch hierarchy
