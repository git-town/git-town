Feature: git-town new-pull-request: when origin is a self hosted servie

  When creating a pull request on a self-hosted repository whose type cannot be derived from its URL
  I want to specify the type of the hosted repository
  So that Git Town can support specific features of my repository platform.


  Scenario Outline: self hosted
    Given I have "open" installed
    And I have a feature branch named "feature"
    And my remote origin is "git@self-hosted:Originate/git-town.git"
    And I configure "git-town.code-hosting-driver" as "<DRIVER>"
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run `git-town new-pull-request`
    Then I see a new pull request with this url in my browser:
      """
      <PULL_REQUEST_URL>
      """

    Examples:
      | DRIVER    | PULL_REQUEST_URL                                                                                                                         |
