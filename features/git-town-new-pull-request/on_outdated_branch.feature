Feature: Syncing before creating the pull request

  As a developer
  I want my feature branch by synced before creating a pull request for it
  So that my reviewers see the most up-to-date version of my code and their review is accurate.


  Background:
    Given my code base has a feature branch named "parent-feature"
    And my code base has a feature branch named "child-feature" as a child of "parent-feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH         | LOCATION | MESSAGE              | FILE NAME          |
      | main           | local    | local main commit    | local_main_file    |
      |                | remote   | remote main commit   | remote_main_file   |
      | parent-feature | local    | local parent commit  | local_parent_file  |
      |                | remote   | remote parent commit | remote_parent_file |
      | child-feature  | local    | local child commit   | local_child_file   |
      |                | remote   | remote child commit  | remote_child_file  |
    And my computer has the "open" tool installed
    And my repo's origin is "git@github.com:git-town/git-town.git"
    And I am on the "child-feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town new-pull-request"


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH         | COMMAND                                                                                   |

      |                | git add -A                                                                                |
      |                | git stash                                                                                 |
      |                | git checkout main                                                                         |

      |                | git push                                                                                  |
      |                | git checkout parent-feature                                                               |

      |                | git push                                                                                  |
      |                | git checkout child-feature                                                                |
      | child-feature  | git merge --no-edit origin/child-feature                                                  |
      |                | git merge --no-edit parent-feature                                                        |
      |                | git push                                                                                  |
      |                | git stash pop                                                                             |
      | <none>         | open https://github.com/git-town/git-town/compare/parent-feature...child-feature?expand=1 |
    Then "open" launches a new pull request with this url in my browser:
      """
      https://github.com/git-town/git-town/compare/parent-feature...child-feature?expand=1
      """
    And I am still on the "child-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And my repository now has the following commits
