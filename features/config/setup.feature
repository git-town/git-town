      # permits or prevents Git hooks while pushing branches.
      # Hooks are enabled by default. If your Git hooks are slow,
      # you can disable them to speed up branch syncing.
      #
      # When disabled, Git Town pushes using the "--no-verify" switch.

      # immediately to origin even if they are empty?
      #
      # When enabled, you can run "git push" right away
      # but creating new branches is slower and
      # it triggers an unnecessary CI run on the empty branch.
      #
      # When disabled, many Git Town commands execute faster
      # and Git Town will create the missing tracking branch
      # on the first run of "git sync".

      # API or web UI.

      # When enabled, branches are always fully up to date when shipped
      # and you get a chance to resolve merge conflicts
      # between the feature branch to ship and the main development branch
      # on the feature branch. This helps keep the main branch green.

      # Should "git sync" also fetch updates from the upstream remote?
      #
      # If an "upstream" remote exists, and this setting is enabled,
      # "git sync" will also update the local main branch
      # with commits from the main branch at the upstream remote.
