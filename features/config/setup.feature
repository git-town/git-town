Feature: enter Git Town configuration

  Scenario: unconfigured, accept all default values --> working setup
    Given the branches "dev" and "production"
    And local Git setting "init.defaultbranch" is "main"
    And Git Town is not configured
    When I run "git-town config setup" and enter into the dialogs:
      | DIALOG                      | KEYS  |
      | aliases                     | enter |
      | main development branch     | enter |
      | perennial branches          | enter |
      | hosting platform            | enter |
      | sync-feature-strategy       | enter |

      | ship-delete-tracking-branch | enter |
      | sync-before-ship            | enter |
    Then it runs no commands
    And the main branch is now "main"
    And there are still no perennial branches
    And local Git Town setting "code-hosting-platform" is still not set
    And local Git Town setting "push-new-branches" is now "false"
    And local Git Town setting "push-hook" is now "true"
    And local Git Town setting "sync-feature-strategy" is now "merge"

  Scenario: change existing configuration
    Given a perennial branch "qa"
    And a branch "production"
    And the main branch is "main"
    And local Git Town setting "push-new-branches" is "false"
    And local Git Town setting "push-hook" is "false"

    Then it runs the commands
      | COMMAND                                                      |

  Scenario: override an existing Git alias
    Given I ran "git config --global alias.append checkout"
    When I run "git-town config setup" and enter into the dialogs:
      | DIALOG                      | KEYS    |
      | aliases                     | o enter |

      | git config --global alias.append "town append" |
    And global Git setting "alias.append" is now "town append"

  Scenario: don't ask for perennial branches if no branches that could be perennial exist
    Given Git Town is not configured
    When I run "git-town config setup" and enter into the dialog:
      | DIALOG                      | KEYS       | DESCRIPTION                                 |

    Then the main branch is now "main"
    And there are still no perennial branches

  Scenario: remove an existing code hosting override
    Given local Git Town setting "code-hosting-platform" is "github"
    When I run "git-town config setup" and enter into the dialog:
