Feature: a global API token of another forge exists

  Scenario: on GitHub, with global GitLab token
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And my repo's "origin" remote is "git@github.com:git-town/git-town.git"
    And global Git setting "git-town.gitlab-token" is "987654"
    # TODO: move "unknown branch type" below "feature regex"
    When I run "git-town config setup" and enter into the dialog:
      | DIALOG                      | KEYS              | DESCRIPTION                                 |

    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | COMMAND                                         |
      | git config --local git-town.github-token 123456 |
    And local Git setting "git-town.forge-type" still doesn't exist
    And local Git setting "git-town.github-token" is now "123456"
    And local Git setting "git-town.gitlab-token" now doesn't exist
    And global Git setting "git-town.gitlab-token" is still "987654"
