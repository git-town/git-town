Feature: Accepting all default values leads to a working setup

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME       | TYPE   | LOCATIONS     |
      | dev        | (none) | local, origin |
      | production | (none) | local, origin |
    And local Git setting "init.defaultbranch" is "main"
    And Git Town is not configured
    When I run "git-town config setup" and enter into the dialogs:
      | DIALOG                      | KEYS  |
      | welcome                     | enter |
