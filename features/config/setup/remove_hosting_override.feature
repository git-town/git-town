  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | COMMAND                                      |
      | git config --unset git-town.hosting-platform |
    And local Git Town setting "hosting-platform" now doesn't exist

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    And local Git Town setting "hosting-platform" is now "github"
