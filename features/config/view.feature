Feature: show the configuration

  Scenario: all configured, no nested branches
    Given the main branch is "main"
    And the perennial branches are "qa" and "staging"
    When I run "git-town config"
    Then it prints:

      Perennial branches:

  Scenario: all configured, with nested branches
