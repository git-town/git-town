Feature: display configuration from Git metadata in detached head state

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME      | TYPE      | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | branch    | feature   | main   | local         |
      | observed  | observed  |        | local, origin |
      | parked    | parked    | main   | local         |
      | perennial | perennial |        | local         |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION | MESSAGE  |
      | branch | local    | commit 1 |
      |        | local    | commit 2 |
    And Git setting "git-town.perennial-branches" is "qa staging"
    And Git setting "git-town.auto-sync" is "false"
    And Git setting "git-town.display-types" is "all"
    And Git setting "git-town.perennial-regex" is "^release-"
    And Git setting "git-town.contribution-regex" is "^renovate/"
    And Git setting "git-town.observed-regex" is "^dependabot/"
    And Git setting "git-town.feature-regex" is "^user-.*$"
    And Git setting "git-town.ship-strategy" is "squash-merge"
    And Git setting "git-town.unknown-branch-type" is "observed"
    And Git setting "git-town.auto-resolve" is "false"
    And Git setting "git-town.detached" is "true"
    And Git setting "git-town.stash" is "false"
    And the current branch is "branch"
    And I ran "git checkout HEAD^"
    When I run "git-town config"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town prints:
