Feature: display configuration from Git metadata in detached head state

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME      | TYPE      | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | branch    | feature   | main   | local         |

      | parked    | parked    | main   | local         |
      | perennial | perennial |        | local         |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION | MESSAGE  |
      | branch | local    | commit 1 |
      |        | local    | commit 2 |
