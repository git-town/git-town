Feature: display information from config file

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME           | TYPE         | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | contribution-1 | contribution |        | local, origin |
      | contribution-2 | contribution |        | local, origin |
      | observed-1     | observed     |        | local, origin |
      | observed-2     | observed     |        | local, origin |
      | parked-1       | parked       | main   | local         |
      | parked-2       | parked       | main   | local         |
      | perennial-1    | perennial    |        | local         |
