Feature: show the configuration

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches

      | contribution-1 | contribution |        | local, origin |

      | observed-1     | observed     |        | local, origin |
      | observed-2     | observed     |        | local, origin |
      | parked-1       | parked       | main   | local         |
      | parked-2       | parked       | main   | local         |
      | perennial-1    | perennial    |        | local         |
      | perennial-2    | perennial    |        | local         |
      | prototype-1    | prototype    | main   | local         |
      | prototype-2    | prototype    | main   | local         |
