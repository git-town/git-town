Feature: delete a parent branch

  Background:
    Given my repo has a feature branch "alpha"
    And my repo has a feature branch "beta" as a child of "alpha"
    And my repo has a feature branch "gamma" as a child of "beta"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      |
      | alpha  | local, remote | alpha commit |
      | beta   | local, remote | beta commit  |
      | gamma  | local, remote | gamma commit |
    And I am on the "gamma" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town kill beta"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | gamma  | git fetch --prune --tags |
      |        | git push origin :beta    |
      |        | git branch -D beta       |
    And I am now on the "gamma" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES           |
      | local, remote | main, alpha, gamma |
    And my repo now has the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      |
      | alpha  | local, remote | alpha commit |
      | gamma  | local, remote | gamma commit |
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH | PARENT |
      | alpha  | main   |
      | gamma  | alpha  |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                                 |
      | gamma  | git branch beta {{ sha 'beta commit' }} |
      |        | git push -u origin beta                 |
    And I am now on the "gamma" branch
    And my workspace has the uncommitted file again
    And my repo is left with my original commits
    And my repo now has its initial branches and branch hierarchy
