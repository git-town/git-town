Feature: killing a branch within a branch chain

  Background:
    Given my repo has a feature branch "feature-1"
    And my repo has a feature branch "feature-2" as a child of "feature-1"
    And my repo has a feature branch "feature-3" as a child of "feature-2"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION      | MESSAGE          |
      | feature-1 | local, remote | feature 1 commit |
      | feature-2 | local, remote | feature 2 commit |
      | feature-3 | local, remote | feature 3 commit |
    And I am on the "feature-3" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town kill feature-2"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                    |
      | feature-3 | git fetch --prune --tags   |
      |           | git push origin :feature-2 |
      |           | git branch -D feature-2    |
    And I am now on the "feature-3" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES                   |
      | local, remote | main, feature-1, feature-3 |
    And my repo now has the following commits
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION      | MESSAGE          |
      | feature-1 | local, remote | feature 1 commit |
      | feature-3 | local, remote | feature 3 commit |
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH    | PARENT    |
      | feature-1 | main      |
      | feature-3 | feature-1 |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                                           |
      | feature-3 | git branch feature-2 {{ sha 'feature 2 commit' }} |
      |           | git push -u origin feature-2                      |
    And I am now on the "feature-3" branch
    And my workspace has the uncommitted file again
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES                              |
      | local, remote | main, feature-1, feature-2, feature-3 |
    And my repo is left with my original commits
    And Git Town now has the original branch hierarchy
