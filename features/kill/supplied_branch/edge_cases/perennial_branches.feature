Feature: does not kill perennial branches

  Scenario: trying to delete the main branch
    Given my repo has a feature branch "feature"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     |
      | main    | local, remote | main commit |
      | feature | local, remote | good commit |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town kill main"
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints the error:
      """
      you can only kill feature branches
      """
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES      |
      | local, remote | main, feature |
    And my repo is left with my original commits
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH  | PARENT |
      | feature | main   |

  Scenario: trying to delete a perennial branch
    Given my repo has a feature branch "feature"
    And my repo has the perennial branch "qa"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     |
      | feature | local, remote | good commit |
      | qa      | local, remote | qa commit   |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town kill qa"
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints the error:
      """
      you can only kill feature branches
      """
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES          |
      | local, remote | main, feature, qa |
    And my repo is left with my original commits
    And Git Town still has the original branch hierarchy
