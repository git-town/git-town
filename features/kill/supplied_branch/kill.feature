Feature: deleting another than the current branch

  Background:
    Given my repo has the feature branches "good-feature" and "dead-feature"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH       | LOCATION      | MESSAGE                              | FILE NAME        |
      | main         | local, remote | conflicting with uncommitted changes | conflicting_file |
      | dead-feature | local, remote | dead-end commit                      | file             |
      | good-feature | local, remote | good commit                          | file             |
    And I am on the "good-feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file with name "conflicting_file" and content "conflicting content"
    When I run "git-town kill dead-feature"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH       | COMMAND                       |
      | good-feature | git fetch --prune --tags      |
      |              | git push origin :dead-feature |
      |              | git branch -D dead-feature    |
    And I am still on the "good-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES           |
      | local, remote | main, good-feature |
    And my repo now has the following commits
      | BRANCH       | LOCATION      | MESSAGE                              |
      | main         | local, remote | conflicting with uncommitted changes |
      | good-feature | local, remote | good commit                          |
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH       | PARENT |
      | good-feature | main   |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH       | COMMAND                                             |
      | good-feature | git branch dead-feature {{ sha 'dead-end commit' }} |
      |              | git push -u origin dead-feature                     |
    And I am still on the "good-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES                         |
      | local, remote | main, dead-feature, good-feature |
    And my repo is left with my original commits
    And Git Town now has the original branch hierarchy
