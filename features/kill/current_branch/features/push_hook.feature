Feature: undo deleting the current feature branch with disabled push-hook

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | current | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | other   | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        |
      | current | local, origin | current commit |
      | other   | local, origin | other commit   |
    And the current branch is "current" and the previous branch is "other"
    And an uncommitted file

  Scenario: set to "false"
    Given Git Town setting "push-hook" is "false"
    When I run "git-town kill"
    And I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                                                   |
      | other   | git push --no-verify origin {{ sha 'current commit' }}:refs/heads/current |
      |         | git branch current {{ sha 'WIP on current' }}                             |
      |         | git checkout current                                                      |
      | current | git reset --soft HEAD~1                                                   |
    And the current branch is now "current"
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And the initial commits exist
    And the initial branches and lineage exist

  Scenario: set to "true"
    Given Git Town setting "push-hook" is "true"
    When I run "git-town kill"
    And I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                                       |
      | other   | git push origin {{ sha 'current commit' }}:refs/heads/current |
      |         | git branch current {{ sha 'WIP on current' }}                 |
      |         | git checkout current                                          |
      | current | git reset --soft HEAD~1                                       |
    And the current branch is now "current"
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And the initial commits exist
    And the initial branches and lineage exist
