Feature: killing a local branch

  Background:
    Given my repo has a feature branch "other-feature"
    And my repo has a local feature branch "current-feature"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH          | LOCATION      | MESSAGE                |
      | current-feature | local         | current feature commit |
      | other-feature   | local, remote | other feature commit   |
    And I am on the "current-feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town kill"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH          | COMMAND                                |
      | current-feature | git fetch --prune --tags               |
      |                 | git add -A                             |
      |                 | git commit -m "WIP on current-feature" |
      |                 | git checkout main                      |
      | main            | git branch -D current-feature          |
    And I am now on the "main" branch
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES            |
      | local, remote | main, other-feature |
    And my repo now has the following commits
      | BRANCH        | LOCATION      | MESSAGE              |
      | other-feature | local, remote | other feature commit |
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH        | PARENT |
      | other-feature | main   |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH          | COMMAND                                                       |
      | main            | git branch current-feature {{ sha 'WIP on current-feature' }} |
      |                 | git checkout current-feature                                  |
      | current-feature | git reset {{ sha 'current feature commit' }}                  |
    And I am now on the "current-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES                             |
      | local      | main, current-feature, other-feature |
      | remote     | main, other-feature                  |
    And my repo is left with my original commits
    And Git Town now has the original branch hierarchy
