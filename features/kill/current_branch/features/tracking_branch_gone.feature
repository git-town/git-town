Feature: killing a branch whose tracking branch is gone

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | current | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | other   | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the current branch is "current"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        |
      | current | local, origin | current commit |
      | other   | local, origin | other commit   |
    And origin deletes the "current" branch
    And the current branch is "current" and the previous branch is "other"
    And an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town kill"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                        |
      | current | git fetch --prune --tags       |
      |         | git add -A                     |
      |         | git commit -m "WIP on current" |
      |         | git checkout other             |
      | other   | git branch -D current          |
    And the current branch is now "other"
    And no uncommitted files exist
    And the branches are now
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES    |
      | local, origin | main, other |
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      |
      | other  | local, origin | other commit |
    And this lineage exists now
      | BRANCH | PARENT |
      | other  | main   |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                       |
      | other   | git branch current {{ sha 'WIP on current' }} |
      |         | git checkout current                          |
      | current | git reset --soft HEAD~1                       |
    And the current branch is now "current"
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE        |
      | current | local         | current commit |
      | other   | local, origin | other commit   |
    And the initial branches and lineage exist
