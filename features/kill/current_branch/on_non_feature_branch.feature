Feature: git town-kill: errors when trying to kill a perennial branch

  As a developer accidentally trying to kill a perennial branch
  I should see an error that I cannot delete perennial branches
  So that my release infrastructure remains intact and my project stays shippable.


  Background:
    Given I have a perennial branch named "qa"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH | LOCATION         | MESSAGE   |
      | qa     | local and remote | qa commit |
    And I am on the "qa" branch


  Scenario: result
    Given I have an uncommitted file
    When I run `git-town kill`
    Then it runs no commands
    And I get the error "You can only kill feature branches"
    And I am still on the "qa" branch
    And I still have my uncommitted file
    And the existing branches are
      | REPOSITORY | BRANCHES |
      | local      | main, qa |
      | remote     | main, qa |
    And I am left with my original commits
