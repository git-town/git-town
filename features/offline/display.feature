Feature: Displaying the current offline status

  When configuring offline mode
  I want to know the current value for it
  So that I can decide whether I want to adjust it.


  Scenario: set to "true"
    Given Git Town is in offline mode
    When I run "git-town offline"
    Then it prints:
      """
      true
      """


  Scenario: set to "false"
    When I run "git-town offline"
    Then it prints:
      """
      false
      """


  Scenario: invalid value
    Given the offline configuration is accidentally set to "zonk"
    When I run "git-town offline"
    Then it prints:
      """
      Invalid value for git-town.offline: "zonk". Please provide either true or false. Considering false for now.
      """
