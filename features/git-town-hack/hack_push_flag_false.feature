Feature: git town-hack: don't push branch to remote upon creation

  As a developer starting work on a new private feature
  I don't want git-hack to push my branch to the remote repo
  So that my CI server doesn't unnecessarily run tests for commits without changes


  Background:
    Given my repository has the "hack-push-flag" configuration set to "false"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH | LOCATION | MESSAGE       |
      | main   | remote   | remote commit |
    And I am on the "main" branch
    When I run `git-town hack private-feature`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                              |
      | main   | git fetch --prune                    |
      |        | git rebase origin/main               |
      |        | git checkout -b private-feature main |
    And I end up on the "private-feature" branch
    And I have the following commits
      | BRANCH          | LOCATION         | MESSAGE       |
      | main            | local and remote | remote commit |
      | private-feature | local            | remote commit |
