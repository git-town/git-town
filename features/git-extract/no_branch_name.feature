Feature: git extract: errors if no branch name is given

  As a developer forgetting to provide the name of the branch to extract into
  I should see an error explaining the usage of this command
  So that I can use it correctly without having to read the readme again.


  Background:
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE            | FILE NAME        |
      | main    | remote   | remote main commit | remote_main_file |
      | feature | local    | feature commit     | feature_file     |
      |         |          | refactor commit    | refactor_file    |
    And I am on the "feature" branch


  Scenario: with open changes
    Given I have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted" and content: "stuff"
    When I run `git extract` while allowing errors
    Then it runs no Git commands
    And I get the error "No branch name provided"
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
    And I still have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted" and content: "stuff"


  Scenario: without open changes
    When I run `git extract` while allowing errors
    Then it runs no Git commands
    And I get the error "No branch name provided"
    And I am still on the "feature" branch
