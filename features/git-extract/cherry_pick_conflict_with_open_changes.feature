Feature: git-extract handling cherry-pick conflicts with open changes

  Background:
    Given I have a feature branch named "feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE            | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT     |
      | main    | local    | conflicting commit | conflicting_file | main content     |
      | feature | local    | feature commit     | feature_file     |                  |
      |         |          | refactor commit    | conflicting_file | refactor content |
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    And I have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted" and content: "stuff"
    When I run `git extract refactor` with the last commit sha while allowing errors

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the Git commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                                  |
      | feature  | git stash -u                             |
      | feature  | git checkout main                        |
      | main     | git fetch --prune                        |
      | main     | git rebase origin/main                   |
      | main     | git push                                 |
      | main     | git checkout -b refactor main            |
      | refactor | git cherry-pick [["feature" branch SHA]] |
    And I end up on the "refactor" branch
    And I don't have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted"
    And my repo has a cherry-pick in progress
    And there is an abort script for "git extract"


  Scenario: aborting
    When I run `git extract --abort`
    Then it runs the Git commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                 |
      | refactor | git cherry-pick --abort |
      | refactor | git checkout feature    |
      | feature  | git branch -D refactor  |
      | feature  | git stash pop           |
    And I end up on the "feature" branch
    And I again have an uncommitted file with name: "uncommitted" and content: "stuff"
    And there is no "refactor" branch
    And I have the following commits
      | BRANCH   | LOCATION         | MESSAGE            | FILES            |
      | main     | local and remote | conflicting commit | conflicting_file |
      | feature  | local            | feature commit     | feature_file     |
      |          |                  | refactor commit    | conflicting_file |
    And my repo has no cherry-pick in progress
    And there is no abort script for "git extract" anymore
