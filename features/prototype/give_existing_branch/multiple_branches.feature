Feature: make multiple branches prototype

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME         | TYPE         | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature      | feature      | main   | local, origin |
      | contribution | contribution |        | local, origin |
      | observed     | observed     |        | local, origin |
      | parked       | parked       | main   | local, origin |
    And an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town prototype feature contribution observed parked"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints:
      """
      branch "feature" is now a prototype branch
      """
    And branch "feature" is now prototype
    And it prints:
      """
      branch "contribution" is now a prototype branch
      """
    And branch "contribution" is now prototype
    And it prints:
      """
      branch "observed" is now a prototype branch
      """
    And branch "observed" is now prototype
    And it prints:
      """
      branch "parked" is now a prototype branch
      """
    And branch "parked" is now prototype
    And branch "parked" is still parked
    And the current branch is still "main"
    And the uncommitted file still exists

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND       |
      | main   | git add -A    |
      |        | git stash     |
      |        | git stash pop |
    And there are now no prototype branches
    And branch "contribution" is now a contribution branch
    And branch "observed" is now observed
    And branch "parked" is still parked
    And the current branch is still "main"
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And the initial branches and lineage exist
