Feature: disable auto-resolution of phantom merge conflicts via config setting when parent and child modify the same file and the parent gets shipped

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT   |
      | main   | local, origin | main commit | file      | line 1\nline 2 |
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | branch-1 | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH   | LOCATION      | MESSAGE         | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT                       |
      | branch-1 | local, origin | branch-1 commit | file      | line 1 changed by branch-1\nline 2 |
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE    | PARENT   | LOCATIONS     |
      | branch-2 | feature | branch-1 | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH   | LOCATION | MESSAGE         | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT                                           |
      | branch-2 | local    | branch-2 commit | file      | line 1 changed by branch-1\nline 2 changed by branch-2 |
    And Git setting "git-town.sync-feature-strategy" is "merge"
    And Git setting "git-town.auto-resolve" is "no"
    And origin ships the "branch-1" branch using the "squash-merge" ship-strategy
    And the current branch is "branch-2"
    When I run "git-town sync"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                                           |
      | branch-2 | git fetch --prune --tags                          |
      |          | git checkout main                                 |
      | main     | git -c rebase.updateRefs=false rebase origin/main |
      |          | git branch -D branch-1                            |
      |          | git checkout branch-2                             |
      | branch-2 | git merge --no-edit --ff main                     |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file
      """
    And file "file" now has content:
      """
      line 1 changed by branch-1
      <<<<<<< HEAD
      line 2 changed by branch-2
      =======
      line 2
      >>>>>>> main
      """
    And a merge is now in progress

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git town undo"
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                                                 |
      | branch-2 | git merge --abort                                       |
      |          | git checkout main                                       |
      | main     | git reset --hard {{ sha 'main commit' }}                |
      |          | git branch branch-1 {{ sha-initial 'branch-1 commit' }} |
      |          | git checkout branch-2                                   |
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH   | LOCATION      | MESSAGE         | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT                                           |
      | main     | local, origin | main commit     | file      | line 1\nline 2                                         |
      |          | origin        | branch-1 commit | file      | line 1 changed by branch-1\nline 2                     |
      | branch-1 | local         | branch-1 commit | file      | line 1 changed by branch-1\nline 2                     |
      | branch-2 | local         | branch-2 commit | file      | line 1 changed by branch-1\nline 2 changed by branch-2 |
      |          | origin        | branch-1 commit | file      | line 1 changed by branch-1\nline 2                     |
    And no merge is now in progress

  Scenario: run without resolving the conflicts
    When I run "git town continue"
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      you must resolve the conflicts before continuing
      """
    And a merge is still in progress

  Scenario: resolve the conflicts and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "file" with "content_2"
    And I run "git town continue"
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                                  |
      | branch-2 | git commit --no-edit                     |

      | branch-2 | local, origin | branch-1 commit                   | file      | line 1 changed by branch-1\nline 2                     |

      |          |               | Merge branch 'main' into branch-2 | file      | content_2                                              |
    And no merge is now in progress

  Scenario: resolve the conflicts, commit, and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "file" with "content_2"
    And I ran "git commit --no-edit"
    And I run "git town continue"
    Then Git Town runs the commands
