Feature: handle merge conflicts between feature branch and main branch

  Background:
    Given my repo has the local feature branches "alpha", "beta", and "gamma"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT  |
      | main   | origin        | main commit  | conflicting_file | main content  |
      | alpha  | local, origin | alpha commit | feature1_file    | alpha content |
      | beta   | local, origin | beta commit  | conflicting_file | beta content  |
      | gamma  | local, origin | gamma commit | feature2_file    | gamma content |
    And I am on the "main" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town sync --all"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                          |
      | main   | git fetch --prune --tags         |
      |        | git add -A                       |
      |        | git stash                        |
      |        | git rebase origin/main           |
      |        | git checkout alpha               |
      | alpha  | git merge --no-edit origin/alpha |
      |        | git merge --no-edit main         |
      |        | git push                         |
      |        | git checkout beta                |
      | beta   | git merge --no-edit origin/beta  |
      |        | git merge --no-edit main         |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      To abort, run "git-town abort".
      To continue after having resolved conflicts, run "git-town continue".
      To continue by skipping the current branch, run "git-town skip".

    And I am now on the "beta" branch
    And my uncommitted file is stashed

  Scenario: abort

    And I am now on the "main" branch
    And my workspace has the uncommitted file again
    And there is no merge in progress
