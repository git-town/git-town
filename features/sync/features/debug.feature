Feature: display debug statistics

  Background:
    Given the current branch is a feature branch "feature"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE               |
      | main    | local    | local main commit     |
      |         | origin   | origin main commit    |
      | feature | local    | local feature commit  |
      |         | origin   | origin feature commit |

  Scenario: result
    When I run "git-town sync --debug"
    Then it prints:
      """
      Ran 28 shell commands.
      """
    And all branches are now synchronized
