Feature: handle conflicts between the current prototype branch and its tracking branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME      | TYPE      | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | prototype | prototype | main   | local, origin |
    And the current branch is "prototype"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION | MESSAGE                   | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT   |
      | prototype | local    | conflicting local commit  | conflicting_file | local content  |
      |           | origin   | conflicting origin commit | conflicting_file | origin content |
    And an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town sync"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                                   |
      | prototype | git fetch --prune --tags                  |
      |           | git add -A                                |
      |           | git stash                                 |
      |           | git checkout main                         |
      | main      | git rebase origin/main                    |
      |           | git checkout prototype                    |
      | prototype | git merge --no-edit --ff origin/prototype |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in conflicting_file
      """
    And it prints the error:
      """
      To continue after having resolved conflicts, run "git town continue".
      To go back to where you started, run "git town undo".
      To continue by skipping the current branch, run "git town skip".
      """
    And a merge is now in progress
    And the uncommitted file is stashed

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND           |
      | prototype | git merge --abort |
      |           | git stash pop     |
    And the current branch is still "prototype"
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And no rebase is in progress
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now

  Scenario: continue with unresolved conflict
    When I run "git-town continue"
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints the error:
      """
      you must resolve the conflicts before continuing
      """
    And the uncommitted file is stashed
    And a merge is now in progress

  Scenario: resolve and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git-town continue" and close the editor
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                       |
      | prototype | git commit --no-edit          |
      |           | git merge --no-edit --ff main |
      |           | git stash pop                 |
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH    | LOCATION      | MESSAGE                                                        |
      | prototype | local         | conflicting local commit                                       |
      |           | local, origin | conflicting origin commit                                      |
      |           | local         | Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/prototype' into prototype |
    And the current branch is still "prototype"
    And no rebase is in progress
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And these committed files exist now
      | BRANCH    | NAME             | CONTENT          |
      | prototype | conflicting_file | resolved content |

  Scenario: resolve, finish the rebase, and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git rebase --continue" and close the editor
    And I run "git-town continue"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH    | COMMAND                       |
      | prototype | git commit --no-edit          |

    And these commits exist now
