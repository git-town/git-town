Feature: handle conflicts between the current feature branch and the main branch (in a local repo)

  Background:
    Given a local Git repo clone
    And the branch
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS |
      | feature | feature | main   | local     |
    And the current branch is "feature"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE                    | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT    |
      | main    | local    | conflicting main commit    | conflicting_file | main content    |
      | feature | local    | conflicting feature commit | conflicting_file | feature content |
    And an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town sync"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                       |
      | feature | git add -A                    |
      |         | git stash                     |
      |         | git merge --no-edit --ff main |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in conflicting_file
      """
    And it prints the error:
      """
      To continue after having resolved conflicts, run "git town continue".
      To go back to where you started, run "git town undo".
      To continue by skipping the current branch, run "git town skip".
      """
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the uncommitted file is stashed
    And a merge is now in progress

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND           |
      | feature | git merge --abort |
      |         | git stash pop     |
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And no merge is in progress
    And the initial commits exist

  Scenario: continue with unresolved conflict
    When I run "git-town continue"
    Then it runs no commands
    And it prints the error:
      """
      you must resolve the conflicts before continuing
      """
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And the uncommitted file is stashed
    And a merge is now in progress

  Scenario: resolve and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git-town continue"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND              |
      | feature | git commit --no-edit |
      |         | git stash pop        |
    And all branches are now synchronized
    And the current branch is still "feature"
    And no merge is in progress
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And these committed files exist now
      | BRANCH  | NAME             | CONTENT          |
      | main    | conflicting_file | main content     |
      | feature | conflicting_file | resolved content |

  Scenario: resolve, commit, and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git commit --no-edit"
    And I run "git-town continue"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND       |
      | feature | git stash pop |
