Feature: sync a branch with unmerged commits whose tracking branch was deleted

  Background:
    Given the feature branches "active" and "old"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE       |
      | active | local, origin | active commit |
      | old    | local, origin | old commit    |
    And origin deletes the "old" branch
    And the current branch is "old"
    And an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town sync"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | old    | git fetch --prune --tags |
      |        | git add -A               |
      |        | git stash                |
      |        | git checkout main        |
      | main   | git rebase origin/main   |
      |        | git branch -D old        |
      |        | git stash pop            |
    And the current branch is now "main"
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And the branches are now
      | REPOSITORY    | BRANCHES     |
      | local, origin | main, active |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                               |
      | main   | git add -A                            |
      |        | git stash                             |
      |        | git branch old {{ sha 'old commit' }} |
      |        | git checkout old                      |
      | old    | git stash pop                         |
    And the current branch is now "old"
    And the uncommitted file still exists
    And the initial branches and hierarchy exist
