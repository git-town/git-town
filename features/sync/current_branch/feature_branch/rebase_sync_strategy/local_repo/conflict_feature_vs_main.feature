Feature: handle conflicts between the current feature branch and the main branch (in a local repo)

  Background:
    Given a local Git repo
    And Git setting "git-town.sync-feature-strategy" is "rebase"
    And I ran "git-town hack feature"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION | MESSAGE                    | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT    |
      | main    | local    | conflicting main commit    | conflicting_file | main content    |
      | feature | local    | conflicting feature commit | conflicting_file | feature content |
    And the current branch is "feature"
    When I run "git-town sync"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                                                      |
      | feature | git -c rebase.updateRefs=false rebase --onto main {{ sha 'initial commit' }} |
      |         | git checkout --theirs conflicting_file                                       |
      |         | git add conflicting_file                                                     |
      |         | GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue                                        |
    # TODO: This wrongfully assumes this is a phantom merge conflict,
    # and resolves it the wrong way. It should stop and let the user resolve this.
    And no rebase is now in progress
    And all branches are now synchronized
    And these committed files exist now
      | BRANCH  | NAME             | CONTENT         |
      | main    | conflicting_file | main content    |
      | feature | conflicting_file | feature content |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                                 |
      | feature | git reset --hard {{ sha 'conflicting feature commit' }} |
    And no rebase is now in progress
    And the initial commits exist now
