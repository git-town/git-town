Feature: compatibility between different sync-feature-strategy settings

  Scenario: I use rebase and my coworker uses merge
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature | feature | main   | local, origin |
    Given Git Town setting "sync-feature-strategy" is "rebase"
    And the current branch is "feature"
    And a coworker clones the repository
    And the coworker fetches updates
    And the coworker sets the "sync-feature-strategy" to "merge"
    And the coworker is on the "feature" branch
    And the coworker sets the parent branch of "feature" as "main"

    # I make a commit and sync
    Given I add this commit to the current branch:
      | MESSAGE         | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT |
      | my first commit | file.txt  | my content   |
    When I run "git town sync"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                         |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags                        |
      |         | git checkout main                               |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main --no-update-refs         |
      |         | git checkout feature                            |
      | feature | git rebase main --no-update-refs                |
      |         | git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes |
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE         | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT |
      | feature | local, origin | my first commit | file.txt  | my content   |
    And all branches are now synchronized

    # coworker makes a conflicting local commit concurrently with me and then syncs
    Given the coworker adds this commit to their current branch:
      | MESSAGE               | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT     |
      | coworker first commit | file.txt  | coworker content |
    When the coworker runs "git-town sync"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                 |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags                |
      |         | git checkout main                       |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main --no-update-refs |
      |         | git checkout feature                    |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit --ff origin/feature |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      To continue after having resolved conflicts, run "git town continue".
      """
    When the coworker resolves the conflict in "file.txt" with "my and coworker content"
    And the coworker runs "git town continue" and closes the editor
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                       |
      | feature | git commit --no-edit          |
      |         | git merge --no-edit --ff main |
      |         | git push                      |
    And all branches are now synchronized
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION                | MESSAGE                                                    | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT     |
      | feature | local, coworker, origin | my first commit                                            | file.txt  | my content       |
      |         | coworker, origin        | coworker first commit                                      | file.txt  | coworker content |
      |         |                         | Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/feature' into feature |           |                  |
    And the coworkers workspace now contains file "file.txt" with content "my and coworker content"

    # I add a conflicting commit locally and then sync
    Given I add this commit to the current branch:
      | MESSAGE          | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT   |
      | my second commit | file.txt  | my new content |
    When I run "git-town sync"
    Then it runs the commands

    When I resolve the conflict in "file.txt" with "my new and coworker content"
