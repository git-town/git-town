Feature: compatibility between different sync-feature-strategy settings when editing independent changes

  Scenario: I use rebase and my coworker uses merge
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME    | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | feature | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT     |
      | feature | local, origin | set up file | file.txt  | line 1\n\nline 2 |
    And Git setting "git-town.sync-feature-strategy" is "rebase"
    And the current branch is "feature"
    And a coworker clones the repository
    And the coworker fetches updates
    And the coworker sets the "sync-feature-strategy" to "merge"
    And the coworker is on the "feature" branch
    And the coworker sets the parent branch of "feature" as "main"
    #
    # I make a commit and sync
    Given I add this commit to the current branch:
      | MESSAGE         | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT                   |
      | my first commit | file.txt  | line 1: my content 1\n\nline 2 |
    When I run "git-town sync"
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                         |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags                        |
      |         | git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes |
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION                | MESSAGE         | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT                   |
      | feature | local, coworker, origin | set up file     | file.txt  | line 1\n\nline 2               |
      |         | local, origin           | my first commit | file.txt  | line 1: my content 1\n\nline 2 |
    And all branches are now synchronized
    And no rebase is now in progress
    #
    # coworker makes a conflicting local commit concurrently with me and then syncs
    Given the coworker adds this commit to their current branch:
      | MESSAGE               | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT                          |
      | coworker first commit | file.txt  | line 1:\n\nline 2: coworker content 1 |
    When the coworker runs "git-town sync"
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                                 |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags                |
      |         | git merge --no-edit --ff origin/feature |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
      """
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
      """
    And the coworkers workspace now contains file "file.txt" with content:
      """
      <<<<<<< HEAD
      line 1:
      =======
      line 1: my content 1
      >>>>>>> origin/feature

      line 2: coworker content 1
      """
    When the coworker resolves the conflict in "file.txt" with:
      """
      line 1: my content 1

      line 2: coworker content 1
      """
    And the coworker runs "git town continue" and closes the editor
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND              |
      | feature | git commit --no-edit |
      |         | git push             |
    And all branches are now synchronized
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION                | MESSAGE                                                    | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT                                       |

    #
    # I add a conflicting commit locally and then sync
    Given I add this commit to the current branch:

    When I run "git-town sync"
    # TODO: the conflict below isn't a phantom conflict.
    # Git Town leaves my repository without the coworker changes.
    Then Git Town runs the commands
