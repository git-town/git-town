Feature: sync the current perennial branch using the ff-only sync strategy when out of sync with the tracking branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME       | TYPE      | LOCATIONS     |
      | production | perennial | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH     | LOCATION | MESSAGE       |
      | production | local    | local commit  |
      |            | origin   | origin commit |
    And the current branch is "production"
    And Git setting "git-town.sync-perennial-strategy" is "ff-only"
    When I run "git-town sync"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH     | COMMAND                  |
      | production | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      cannot sync branch "production" because it has unpushed local commits
      """
    And the current branch is still "production"
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
    And the initial commits exist now

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And the current branch is still "production"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
