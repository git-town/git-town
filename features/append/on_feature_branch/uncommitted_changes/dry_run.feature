Feature: dry run appending a new feature branch to an existing feature branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | existing | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH   | LOCATION      | MESSAGE         |
      | existing | local, origin | existing commit |
    And the current branch is "existing"
    And an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town append new --dry-run"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND             |
      | existing | git add -A          |
      |          | git stash           |
      |          | git checkout -b new |
      | new      | git stash pop       |
    And the current branch is still "existing"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
    And the uncommitted file still exists

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs no commands
    And the current branch is still "existing"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial lineage exists now
    And the uncommitted file still exists
