Feature: beam a commit from a stack with dependent changes into a prepended branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And Git setting "git-town.sync-feature-strategy" is "rebase"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT           |
      | main   | local, origin | main commit | file      | line 1\nline 2\nline 3 |
    And the branches
      | NAME | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | old  | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE  | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT                                                                 |
      | old    | local, origin | commit 1 | file      | line 1: commit-1 changes\nline 2\nline 3                                     |
      | old    | local, origin | commit 2 | file      | line 1: commit-1 changes\nline 2: commit-2 changes\nline 3                   |
      | old    | local, origin | commit 3 | file      | line 1: commit-1 changes\nline 2: commit-2 changes\nline 3: commit-3 changes |
    And the current branch is "old"
    When I run "git-town prepend new --beam" and enter into the dialog:
      | DIALOG          | KEYS             | COMMENT         |
      | commits to beam | down space enter | select commit 2 |
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                                      |
      | old    | git checkout -b new main                     |
      | new    | git cherry-pick {{ sha-initial 'commit 2' }} |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """

      """
    And file "file" now has content:
