Feature: prepend a branch to a feature branch

  Background:
    Given the current branch is a feature branch "old"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE    |
      | old    | local, origin | old commit |
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town prepend parent"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | old    | git fetch --prune --tags |
      |        | git add -A               |
      |        | git stash                |
      |        | git checkout main        |
      | main   | git rebase origin/main   |
      |        | git branch parent main   |
      |        | git checkout parent      |
      | parent | git stash pop            |
    And the current branch is now "parent"
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And now these commits exist
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE    |
      | old    | local, origin | old commit |
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH | PARENT |
      | old    | parent |
      | parent | main   |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND              |
      | parent | git add -A           |
      |        | git stash            |
      |        | git checkout main    |
      | main   | git branch -d parent |
      |        | git checkout old     |
      | old    | git stash pop        |
    And the current branch is now "old"
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And now the initial commits exist
    And Git Town is now aware of the initial branch hierarchy
