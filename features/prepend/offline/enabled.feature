Feature: offline mode

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | old  | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE    |
      | old    | local, origin | old commit |
    And offline mode is enabled
    And the current branch is "old"
    When I run "git-town prepend new"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | old    | git checkout -b new main |
    And this lineage exists now
      """
      main
        new
          old
      """
    And these commits exist now
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE    |
      | old    | local, origin | old commit |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND           |
      | new    | git checkout old  |
      | old    | git branch -D new |
    And the initial lineage exists now
    And the initial commits exist now
