Feature: already existing local branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | old      | feature | main   | local, origin |
      | existing | feature | main   | local         |
    And the current branch is "old"
    And an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town prepend existing"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      there is already a branch "existing"
      """
    And the uncommitted file still exists
#
# NOTE: Cannot test undo here.
# The Git Town command under test has not created an undoable runstate.
# Executing "git town undo" would undo the Git Town command executed during setup.
