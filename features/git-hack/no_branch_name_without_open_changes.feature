Feature: git hack: requires a branch name (without open changes)

  (see ./no_branch_name_with_open_changes.feature)


  Background:
    Given I have a feature branch named "existing_feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH           | LOCATION | MESSAGE                 | FILE NAME    |
      | main             | remote   | main commit             | main_file    |
      | existing_feature | local    | existing feature commit | feature_file |
    And I am on the "existing_feature" branch
    When I run `git hack` while allowing errors


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs no Git commands
    And I get the error "No branch name provided"
    And I am still on the "existing_feature" branch
