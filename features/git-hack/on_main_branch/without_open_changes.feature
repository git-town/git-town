Feature: git hack: starting a new feature from the main branch (without open changes)

  (see ./with_open_changes.feature)


  Background:
    Given the following commit exists in my repository
      | BRANCH | LOCATION | MESSAGE     | FILE NAME |
      | main   | remote   | main_commit | main_file |
    And I am on the "main" branch
    When I run `git hack new_feature`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the Git commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                          |
      | main   | git fetch --prune                |
      | main   | git rebase origin/main           |
      | main   | git checkout -b new_feature main |
    And I end up on the "new_feature" branch
    And the branch "new_feature" has not been pushed to the repository
    And I have the following commits
      | BRANCH      | LOCATION         | MESSAGE     | FILE NAME |
      | main        | local and remote | main_commit | main_file |
      | new_feature | local            | main_commit | main_file |
