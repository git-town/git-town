Feature: syncing before creating the pull request

  Background:
    Given my code base has a feature branch named "parent-feature"
    And my code base has a feature branch named "child-feature" as a child of "parent-feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repo
      | BRANCH         | LOCATION | MESSAGE              |
      | main           | local    | local main commit    |
      |                | remote   | remote main commit   |
      | parent-feature | local    | local parent commit  |
      |                | remote   | remote parent commit |
      | child-feature  | local    | local child commit   |
      |                | remote   | remote child commit  |
    And my computer has the "open" tool installed
    And my repo's origin is "git@github.com:git-town/git-town.git"
    And I am on the "child-feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town new-pull-request"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands

      | <none>         | open https://github.com/git-town/git-town/compare/parent-feature...child-feature?expand=1 |
    Then "open" launches a new pull request with this url in my browser:
      """

      """
    And I am still on the "child-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And my repo now has the following commits
