Feature: sync before creating the pull request

  Background:
    Given my repo has a feature branch "parent"
    And my repo has a feature branch "child" as a child of "parent"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION | MESSAGE              |
      | main   | local    | local main commit    |
      |        | origin   | origin main commit   |
      | parent | local    | local parent commit  |
      |        | origin   | origin parent commit |
      | child  | local    | local child commit   |
      |        | origin   | origin child commit  |
    And my computer has the "open" tool installed
    And my repo's origin is "git@github.com:git-town/git-town.git"
    And I am on the "child" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town new-pull-request"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                                                                   |

      |        | git checkout main                                                         |

      | <none> | open https://github.com/git-town/git-town/compare/parent...child?expand=1 |
    And "open" launches a new pull request with this url in my browser:

      """
    And I am still on the "child" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And now these commits exist
