Feature: self-hosted service

  Scenario Outline: self hosted
    Given my computer has the "open" tool installed
    And my repo's origin is "git@self-hosted:git-town/git-town.git"
    And the "code-hosting-driver" setting is "<DRIVER>"
    And the current branch is a feature branch "feature"
    When I run "git-town new-pull-request"
    Then "open" launches a new pull request with this url in my browser:
      """
      <PULL_REQUEST_URL>
      """

    Examples:
      | DRIVER    | PULL_REQUEST_URL                                                                                                                        |
