Feature: git-town new-pull-request: when origin is a self hosted servie

    When creating a pull request on a self-hosted repository whose type cannot be derived from its URL
  I want to specify the type of the hosted repository
  So that Git Town can support specific features of my repository platform.


  Scenario Outline: self hosted
    And my computer has the "open" tool installed
    And my repo has a feature branch named "feature"
    And my repo's origin is "git@self-hosted:git-town/git-town.git"
    And my repo has "git-town.code-hosting-driver" set to "<DRIVER>"
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run "git-town new-pull-request"
    Then "open" launches a new pull request with this url in my browser:
      """
      <PULL_REQUEST_URL>
      """

    Examples:
      | DRIVER    | PULL_REQUEST_URL                                                                                                                        |
