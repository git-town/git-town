Feature: print the URL when no browser installed

  Background:
    Given my repo has a feature branch named "feature"
    And my repo's origin is "git@github.com:git-town/git-town"
    And my computer has no tool to open browsers installed
    And I am on the "feature" branch
    When I run "git-town new-pull-request"

  @skipWindows
  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                            |
      | feature | git fetch --prune --tags           |
      |         | git checkout main                  |
      | main    | git rebase origin/main             |
      |         | git checkout feature               |
      | feature | git merge --no-edit origin/feature |
      |         | git merge --no-edit main           |
    And it prints:
      """
      Please open in a browser: https://github.com/git-town/git-town/compare/feature?expand=1
      """

  @skipWindows
  Scenario: undo
