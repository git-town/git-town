Feature: Syncing before creating the pull request

  As a developer
  I want my feature branch by synced before creating a pull request for it
  So that my reviewers see the most up-to-date version of my code and their review is accurate.


  Background:
    Given I have a feature branch named "parent-feature"
    And I have a feature branch named "child-feature" as a child of "parent-feature"
    And the following commits exist in my repository
      | BRANCH         | LOCATION | MESSAGE              | FILE NAME          |
      | main           | local    | local main commit    | local_main_file    |
      |                | remote   | remote main commit   | remote_main_file   |
      | parent-feature | local    | local parent commit  | local_parent_file  |
      |                | remote   | remote parent commit | remote_parent_file |
      | child-feature  | local    | local child commit   | local_child_file   |
      |                | remote   | remote child commit  | remote_child_file  |
    And I have "open" installed
    And my remote origin is git@github.com:Originate/git-town.git
    And I am on the "child-feature" branch
    And I have an uncommitted file
    When I run `git-town new-pull-request`


  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH         | COMMAND                                                                                    |

      |                | git add -A                                                                                 |

      |                | git stash pop                                                                              |
      | <none>         | open https://github.com/Originate/git-town/compare/parent-feature...child-feature?expand=1 |
    And I see a new GitHub pull request for the "child-feature" branch against the "parent-feature" branch in the "Originate/git-town" repo in my browser
    And I am still on the "child-feature" branch
    And I still have my uncommitted file
    And I have the following commits
