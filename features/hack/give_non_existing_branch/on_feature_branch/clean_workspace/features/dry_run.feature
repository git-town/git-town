Feature: dry-run hacking a new feature branch

  Background:
    Given the current branch is a feature branch "existing"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH   | LOCATION | MESSAGE         |
      | main     | origin   | main commit     |
      | existing | local    | existing commit |
    When I run "git-town hack new --dry-run"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                  |
      | existing | git fetch --prune --tags |
      |          | git checkout main        |
      | main     | git rebase origin/main   |
      |          | git branch new main      |
      |          | git checkout new         |
    And the current branch is still "existing"
    And the initial commits exist
    And the initial branches and lineage exist

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs no commands
    And the current branch is still "existing"
    And the initial commits exist
    And the initial branches and lineage exist
