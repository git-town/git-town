Feature: conflicts between uncommitted changes and the main branch

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME     | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | existing | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the current branch is "existing"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE            | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT |
      | main   | local, origin | conflicting commit | conflicting_file | main content |
    And an uncommitted file with name "conflicting_file" and content "conflicting content"
    When I run "git-town hack new"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                  |
      | existing | git add -A               |
      |          | git stash                |
      |          | git checkout -b new main |
      | new      | git stash pop            |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      conflicts between your uncommmitted changes and the main branch
      """
    And file "conflicting_file" still contains unresolved conflicts

  Scenario: undo with unresolved merge conflict
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                                          |
      | new      | git add -A                                       |
      |          | git commit -m "Committing WIP for git town undo" |
      |          | git checkout existing                            |
      | existing | git branch -D new                                |
      |          | git stash pop                                    |
    And the current branch is now "existing"
    And file "conflicting_file" still has content "conflicting content"

  Scenario: resolve and undo
    Given I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                                          |
      | new      | git add -A                                       |
      |          | git commit -m "Committing WIP for git town undo" |
      |          | git checkout existing                            |
      | existing | git branch -D new                                |
      |          | git stash pop                                    |
    And it does not print "to go back to where you started, run \"git-town undo\""
    And the current branch is now "existing"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And file "conflicting_file" still has content "conflicting content"

  Scenario: continue with unresolved conflict
    When I run "git-town continue"
    Then it prints the error:
      """
      you must resolve the conflicts before continuing
      """

  Scenario: resolve and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git-town continue" and close the editor
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND        |
      | new    | git stash drop |
    And the current branch is now "new"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And file "conflicting_file" now has content "resolved content"

  Scenario: resolve, continue, and undo undoes the hack but cannot get back to the original branch due to merge conflicts
    Given I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git-town continue" and close the editor
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND               |
      | new      | git add -A            |
      |          | git stash             |
      |          | git checkout existing |
      | existing | git branch -D new     |
      |          | git stash pop         |
    And the current branch is now "existing"
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now
    And file "conflicting_file" now has content "resolved content"
