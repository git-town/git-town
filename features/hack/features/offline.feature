Feature: offline mode

  Background:
    Given Git Town is in offline mode
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     |
      | main   | local, remote | main commit |
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town hack feature"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND                 |
      | main    | git add -A              |
      |         | git stash               |
      |         | git rebase origin/main  |
      |         | git branch feature main |
      |         | git checkout feature    |
      | feature | git stash pop           |
    And I am now on the "feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And my repo now has the following commits
      | BRANCH  | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     |
      | main    | local, remote | main commit |
      | feature | local         | main commit |
    And Git Town is now aware of this branch hierarchy
      | BRANCH  | PARENT |
      | feature | main   |

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH  | COMMAND               |
      | feature | git add -A            |
      |         | git stash             |
      |         | git checkout main     |
      | main    | git branch -d feature |
      |         | git stash pop         |
    And I am now on the "main" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And my repo is left with my original commits
    And Git Town now has no branch hierarchy information
