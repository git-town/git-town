Feature: conflicts between the main branch and its tracking branch

  Background:
    Given my repo has a feature branch "existing-feature"
    And my repo contains the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION | MESSAGE                   | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT   |
      | main   | local    | conflicting local commit  | conflicting_file | local content  |
      |        | remote   | conflicting remote commit | conflicting_file | remote content |
    And I am on the "existing-feature" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file
    When I run "git-town hack new-feature"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH           | COMMAND                  |
      | existing-feature | git fetch --prune --tags |
      |                  | git add -A               |
      |                  | git stash                |
      |                  | git checkout main        |
      | main             | git rebase origin/main   |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      To abort, run "git-town abort".
      To continue after having resolved conflicts, run "git-town continue".
      """
    And my repo now has a rebase in progress
    And my uncommitted file is stashed

  Scenario: aborting
    When I run "git-town abort"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH           | COMMAND                       |
      | main             | git rebase --abort            |
      |                  | git checkout existing-feature |
      | existing-feature | git stash pop                 |
    And I am now on the "existing-feature" branch
    And my workspace has the uncommitted file again
    And there is no rebase in progress anymore
    And my repo is left with my original commits

  Scenario: continuing without resolving the conflicts
    When I run "git-town continue"
    Then it prints the error:
      """
      you must resolve the conflicts before continuing
      """
    And my uncommitted file is stashed
    And my repo still has a rebase in progress

  Scenario: continuing after resolving the conflicts but not finishing the rebase
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git-town continue" and close the editor
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH      | COMMAND                     |
      | main        | git rebase --continue       |
      |             | git push                    |
      |             | git branch new-feature main |
      |             | git checkout new-feature    |
      | new-feature | git stash pop               |
    And I am now on the "new-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
    And my repo now has the following commits
      | BRANCH      | LOCATION      | MESSAGE                   |
      | main        | local, remote | conflicting remote commit |
      |             |               | conflicting local commit  |
      | new-feature | local         | conflicting remote commit |
      |             |               | conflicting local commit  |
    And my repo now has the following committed files
      | BRANCH      | NAME             | CONTENT          |
      | main        | conflicting_file | resolved content |
      | new-feature | conflicting_file | resolved content |

  Scenario: continuing after resolving the conflicts and finishing the rebase
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git rebase --continue" and close the editor
    And I run "git-town continue"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH      | COMMAND                     |
      | main        | git push                    |
      |             | git branch new-feature main |
      |             | git checkout new-feature    |
      | new-feature | git stash pop               |
    And I am now on the "new-feature" branch
    And my workspace still contains my uncommitted file
