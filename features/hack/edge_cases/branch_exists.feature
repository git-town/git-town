Feature: already existing branch

  Scenario Outline:
    Given <LOCATION> has a feature branch "existing"
    When I run "git-town hack existing"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | main   | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      a branch named "existing" already exists
      """

    Examples:
      | LOCATION   |
      | my repo    |
      | the origin |
