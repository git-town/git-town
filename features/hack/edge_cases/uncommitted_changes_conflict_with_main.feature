Feature: conflicts between uncommitted changes and the main branch

  Background:
    Given my repo has a feature branch "existing"
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE            | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT |
      | main   | local, origin | conflicting commit | conflicting_file | main content |
    And I am on the "existing" branch
    And my workspace has an uncommitted file with name "conflicting_file" and content "conflicting content"
    When I run "git-town hack new"

  Scenario: result
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH   | COMMAND                  |
      | existing | git fetch --prune --tags |
      |          | git add -A               |
      |          | git stash                |
      |          | git checkout main        |
      | main     | git rebase origin/main   |
      |          | git branch new main      |
      |          | git checkout new         |
      | new      | git stash pop            |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      conflicts between your uncommmitted changes and the main branch
      """
    And the file "conflicting_file" contains unresolved conflicts

  Scenario: abort with unresolved conflict fails due to unresolved merge conflicts
    When I run "git-town abort"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND           |
      | new    | git checkout main |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      cannot check out branch "main"
      """
    And I am still on the "new" branch

  Scenario: resolve and abort
    Given I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    When I run "git-town abort"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND               |
      | new    | git checkout main     |
      | main   | git branch -d new     |
      |        | git checkout existing |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      cannot check out branch "existing"
      """
    And I am now on the "main" branch
    And now the initial commits exist
    And my workspace now contains the file "conflicting_file" with content "resolved content"

  Scenario: continue with unresolved conflict
    When I run "git-town continue"
    Then it prints the error:
      """
      you must resolve the conflicts before continuing
      """

  Scenario: resolve and continue
    When I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git-town continue" and close the editor
    Then it runs no commands
    And I am now on the "new" branch
    And now these commits exist
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE            | FILE NAME        | FILE CONTENT |
      | main   | local, origin | conflicting commit | conflicting_file | main content |
      | new    | local         | conflicting commit | conflicting_file | main content |
    And my workspace now contains the file "conflicting_file" with content "resolved content"

  Scenario: resolve and undo undoes the hack but cannot get back to the original branch due to merge conflicts
    Given I resolve the conflict in "conflicting_file"
    And I run "git-town continue" and close the editor
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then it runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND               |
      | new    | git checkout main     |
      | main   | git branch -d new     |
      |        | git checkout existing |
    And it prints the error:
      """
      cannot check out branch "existing"
      """
    And I am now on the "main" branch
    And now the initial commits exist
    And my workspace now contains the file "conflicting_file" with content "resolved content"
