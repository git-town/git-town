      # NOTE: Downloading golangci-lint binaries doesn't work as of 2022-05-15.
      #       A likely cause is that this binary is compiled with the wrong version of Go.
      #       Installing from source does work since it uses the native Go toolchain on this machine.
      # TODO: re-enable downloading the binary once the changes introduced in Go 1.18 stabilize
      #       and the ecosystem has caught up with them.
