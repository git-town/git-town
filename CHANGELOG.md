# Git Town Changelog

## 14.1.0 (2024-04-19)

Besides polishing the `git town switch` command, Git Town 14.1 focuses on stability improvements and bashing bugs. We closed out 50% of all open tickets (70 tickets), including many long-standing bugs!

This version also de-emphasizes `git ship`. Most people should not run `git ship`. The recommended workflow is to ship feature branches using the web UI or merge queue of your code hosting platform. `git ship` is for edge cases like development in [offline mode](https://www.git-town.com/commands/offline).

#### New Features

- `git town switch` now has an `-m` option that checks out the selected branch using [git checkout -m](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#Documentation/git-checkout.txt--m) ([#3321](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3321)).
- `git town switch` now doesn't allow selecting branches that are checked out in other Git worktrees ([#3295](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3295)).
- `git town switch` now indicates the existence of uncommitted changes. This helps remember to commit them on the current branch if that was needed ([#3307](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3307)).
- Git Town now shuts down gracefully and allows continue and undo when you press `Ctrl-C` to cancel a Git command that runs too long or hangs ([#414](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/414)).
- Notifications to the user are now highlighted in cyan in the Git Town output, making them easier to spot ([#3353](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3353)).
- The setup assistant now also uses `remotes/origin/HEAD` to determine the default main branch if the already used `init.defaultbranch` setting isn't set ([#646](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/646)).
- Prototypical support for the API of GitHub Enterprise. This is impossible to test for the Git Town team, so please provide bug reports if something doesn't work ([#1179](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/1179)).
- Improved support for GitLab instances that use a custom SSH port ([#1891](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/1891)).
- `git ship` now sqash-merges using the `--ff` option. This removes an incompatibility for users who have the `merge.ff` option set to `false` in their Git configuration ([#1097](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/1097)).
- If a branch is listed as its own parent, Git Town now notifies the user and deletes this invalid lineage entry ([#3393](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3393)).
- Improved error messages ([#2949](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2949)).

#### Bug Fixes

- `git sync` now ends on the previously checked out branch when pruning branches ([#2784](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2784)).
- `git sync --all` now syncs in topological order. This ensures all branches in deep stacks get synced ([#3344](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3344)).
- `git town switch` no longer displays branches that were deleted manually ([#3361](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3361)).
- `git kill` now checks out the main branch when the previous branch also was killed ([#3358](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3358)).

## 14.0.0 (2024-04-12)

Git Town 14.0 improves the developer experience around uncommitted and stacked changes.

#### BREAKING CHANGES

`git hack`, `git append`, and `git prepend` no longer sync the branch lineage in the presence of uncommitted changes. This allows you to commit your changes first before pulling in more changes from other developers. They still sync if you call them without uncommitted changes ([#3198](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3198)).

#### New Features

`git town compress` (aliasable to `git compress` by re-running `git town config setup`) squashes all commits in a branch into a single commit. By default the new commit uses the commit message of the first commit in the branch. You can provide a custom commit message using the `-m` switch the same way as in `git commit`. The `--stack` option compresses all branches in a change stack. Git Town does not compress perennial, observed, contribution, and non-active parked branches ([#1529](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/1529), [#2086](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2086)).

`git hack`, `git append`, and `git prepend` are faster due to creating and checking out the new branch using a single Git operation ([#3313](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3313)).

Big thanks to @blaggacao, @breml, @gabyx, @kevgo, @mball-agathos, @nishchay-manwani-glean, @pjh, @ruudk, @tranhl, @utkinn, and @WhosNickDoglio for contributing code, ideas, and feedback to 68 shipped PRs and 7 resolved issues!

## 13.0.2 (2024-03-29)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a serious bug where users who have [branch.sort](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch#Documentation/git-branch.txt-branchsort) set might get tracking branches removed ([#3241](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3241)).

#### Statistics

Heartfelt thanks to @breml and @kevgo for going the extra mile to investigate a tricky bug and contributing to 25 shipped PRs and 4 resolved issues!

## 13.0.1 (2024-03-27)

#### Bug Fixes

- Allows syncing branches with merge conflicts in linked worktrees ([#3230](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3230)).
- Fixes the Bash-based installer ([#3234](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3234)).

#### Statistics

Many thanks to @alexus37, @breml, @bryanlarsen, @kevgo, @tranhl, @vectro, @wederbrand for contributing feedback, ideas, and solutions to 8 shipped PRs and 6 resolved issues!

## 13.0.0 (2024-03-22)

Git Town 13.0 adds better support for syncing feature branches after rebasing your commits and bumps the required Git version.

#### BREAKING CHANGES

When the [sync-feature-strategy](https://www.git-town.com/preferences/sync-feature-strategy) is set to `rebase`, Git Town now force-pushes your locally rebased commits to the tracking branch ([#3182](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3182)). This avoids mixing locally rebased commits with outdated commits on the tracking branch. To not accidentally override new commits on the tracking branch that haven't been integrated into your local commits, Git Town now force-pushes using the [--force-if-includes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt---no-force-if-includes) Git flag. This requires raising the minimally required Git version from 2.7 to 2.30. Git 2.30 was released over 2 years ago and should be widely available at this point.

#### New Features

- Git Town now automatically removes lineage entries for branches that were converted from feature branches to perennial branches ([#3218](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3218)).
- Git Town documentation and error messages now guide the user to call Git Town as `git town` instead of `git-town` on the CLI ([#3208](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3208)).

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixes a crash when an ustream HEAD is set ([#2660](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2660)).
- Fixes the error message when trying to set the parent of a perennial branch ([#3217](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3217)).

Kudos to @100rab-S, @dgentry, @kevgo, @koppor, @nicksieger, @ruudk, @srstevenson, and @tranhl for contributing code, ideas, and feedback to 18 shipped PRs and 13 resolved issues!

## 12.1.0 (2024-02-29)

Git Town 12.1 implements some of the most requested features by the Git Town community. It also continues the modernization of Git Town's internals. This time we made Git Town's undo engine simpler, more robust, and more reliable by removing all remaining mutable state.

#### New Features

- New options to fine-tune how Git Town syncs branches: `git contribute`, `git observe`, and `git park`. More info at https://www.git-town.com/advanced-syncing and [#3095](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3095).
- All branches matching the regular expression in the new configuration setting [branches.perennial-regex](https://www.git-town.com/preferences/perennial-regex) are now also considered perennial, in addition to the ones already listed in `branches.perennials`. This makes it easier to deal with situations where you have many perennial branches with similar sounding names like `release-1`, `release-2`, etc ([#2659](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2659)).

#### Bug Fixes

- [git town skip](https://www.git-town.com/commands/skip) now works correctly in complex situations ([#2978](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2978)).
- Git Town now deletes branches more reliably ([#3097](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3097)).

#### Statistics

Many thanks to @100rab-S, @harrismcc, @kevgo, @ruudk, @tranhl for contributing feedback, ideas, and solutions to 70 shipped PRs and 11 resolved issues!

## 12.0.2 (2024-02-14)

#### Bug Fixes

- All dialogs that show local branches now paginate ([#3119](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/3119)).

## 12.0.1 (2024-02-12)

#### Bug Fixes

- removes crashes when using a self-hosted platform instance ([#3114](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3114))
- improve the CLI output when using a hosting connector ([#3115](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3115))

## 12.0.0 (2024-02-05)

Git Town 12 continues the effort to make the Git Town user experience more consistent and intuitive by modernizing Git Town's configuration system.

- 294 contributions
- 31 resolved tickets
- a heartfelt thanks to the contributors for this release: @alokpr, @brandonaut, @bryanlarsen, @ChrisMM, @eugef, @IGassmann, @Iron-Ham, @jakeleboeuf, @JaKXz, @kevgo, @koppor, @Nezteb, @ruudk, @zeronacer

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- The new setup assistent (see below) replaces the existing CLI and Git commands to change the configuration.
- Removing the Git Town configuration is now done by running `git town config remove` instead of `git town config reset` ([#3051](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3051)).
- More intuitive names for the following configuration options. Git Town automatically updates the configuration, so no action is needed on your end.
  - `code-hosting-platform` is now `hosting-platform` ([#3054](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3054))
  - `code-hosting-origin-hostname` is now `hosting-origin-hostname` ([#3053](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3053))
  - `ship-delete-remote-branch` is now `ship-delete-tracking-branch` ([#2929](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2929))
- Putting Git Town into offline mode is a top-level command again. Run `git town offline yes` to enable offline mode instead of `git town config offline yes` ([#3049](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3049)).
- All visual dialogs have been rewritten using a modern UI framework for a better look and to avoid the rendering issues encountered before ([#2964](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2964)).
- Nested feature branches are now called "stacked changes" to match the emerging industry term ([#3062](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/3062)).

#### New Features

- Git Town v12 introduces Git Town's setup assistant ([#2941](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2941)). The setup assistant guides you through all of Git Town's configuration settings, including setting up the shorter aliases for Git Town commands. Run it by executing `git town config setup`. This assistant replaces the old configuration commands under `git town config`, the `alias` command, and the old "quick configuration" process.
- Git Town now supports storing non-confidential configuration entries in a configuration file with name `.git-branches.toml` ([#2748](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/2748)). The best way to create one is the setup assistant. The setup assistant can also migrate your existing Git-based configuration to the config file.
- All commands now support the `--dry-run` flag to try them out safely ([#2859](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2859)).
- You can now install Git Town on Windows using Chocolatey: `choco install git-town` ([#763](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/issues/763))
- Massive performance improvements (exceeding 200%) on Windows thanks to not executing Git through the CMD shell anymore ([#2881](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2881)).
- The undo commands execute faster ([#2863](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2863)).

#### Bug Fixes

- Fix the `--version` command on Windows ([#2900](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2900/files)).

## 11.1.0 (2023-12-12)

#### New Features

- Git Town now handles branches checked out in other worktrees correctly ([#2764](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2764))
- Git Town now checks out the previous Git branch ("git checkout -") after removing a local branch ([#2742](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2742))

#### Bug Fixes

- `git continue` now correctly handles a manually popped stash after resolving conflicts ([#2758](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2758))
- `git continue` retries failing commit, merge-proposal, create-branch, create-proposal, create-tracking-branch, and push-branch operations ([#2756](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2756))
- `git continue` ensures there are no untracked files ([#2754](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2754))
- `git switch` now allows switching to perennial branches ([#2752](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2752))

## 11.0.0 (2023-12-06)

Git Town 11 continues the effort to make the Git Town user experience more consistent and intuitive.

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- `git new-pull-request` is now `git propose`. Not all platforms that Git Town supports use the name "pull request", so Git Town uses the word "proposal" for pull requests, merge requests, etc from now on. Nine fewer characters to type! ([#2691](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2691))
- `git abort` is merged into `git undo`. From now on you just run `git undo` after a Git Town command fails or finishes to get back to where you started ([#2719](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2719)).
- Many configuration options now have more intuitive names. No action needed on your end, Git Town automatically updates the affected settings on your machine. This means you can't go back to v10 after updating to v11.
  - `code-hosting-driver` is now `code-hosting-platform` ([#2704](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2704))
  - `main-branch-name` is now `main-branch` ([#2703](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2703))
  - `perennial-branch-names` is now `perennial-branches` ([#2702](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2702))
  - `sync-strategy` is now `sync-feature-strategy` ([#2697](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2697))
  - `pull-branch-strategy` is now `sync-perennial-strategy` ([#2693](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2693))
- `git ship` by default no longer syncs the branch to ship. Set the `sync-before-ship` flag to restore the old behavior. This allows shipping only when the tests pass ([#2735](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2735)).
- Creating proposals on BitBucket uses an updated URL ([#2692](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2692)).
- `git town config reset` now also deletes the branch lineage. This helps get you out of more configuration snafus ([#2733](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2733)).

#### New Features

- The new `sync-before-ship` config option prevents `git ship` from updating the branch it is about to ship. The old behavior makes sense when shipping branches locally but is conflicting with the requirements for tests to pass on CI before shipping via the hosting platform ([#2714](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2714)).

#### Bug Fixes

- allow renaming local-only branches ([#2710](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2710))
- `git repo` and `git propose` always open the browser page at the default port, even if the `origin` remote points to a custom port ([#2730](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2730))

## 10.0.3 (2023-11-25)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fix killing perennial branches ([#2679](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2679))

## 10.0.2 (2023-11-7)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fix wrong error message when `status.short` is enabled in Git config ([#2650](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2650))

## 10.0.1 (2023-11-2)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fix crash if commits contain "[" ([#2645](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2645))

## 10.0.0 (2023-10-27)

Git Town 10 improves support for shipping branches via the code hosting web UI instead of running `git ship`. After merging your branches remotely, run `git sync --all` to sync all local branches and remove the ones shipped at the remote. Don't worry, Git Town ensures that branches which contain unshipped changes won't get deleted. `git undo` brings deleted branches back.

Git Town 10 has improved performance, robustness, and reliability thanks to a large-scale modernization of the Git Town's architecture. Git Town now runs fewer Git commands under the hood to investigate the state of your Git repository. `git undo` now works for all commands thanks to a new undo engine that diffs the before and after state of your Git repo.

Git Town 10 starts a larger effort to remove redundant commands and make Git Town's configuration options more consistent and intuitively named.

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- `git sync` now also removes local branches with a deleted tracking branch, after verifying that those local branches contain no unshipped changes ([#2038](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2038))
- `git town prune-branches` has been sunset, run `git sync` instead ([#2579](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2579))
- Git Town's statefile on disk has a new format, you might have to run `git town status reset` to avoid runtime errors ([#2446](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2446))
- `git ship` no longer ships branches that exist solely at the remote. Moving forward branches to ship must exist on your local machine. Use the web UI of your code hosting service to ship remote branches. ([#2367](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2367), [#2372](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2372))
- `git kill` no longer deletes branches that exist solely at the remote. Delete them by running `git push origin :branchname` or via the web UI of your code hosting service ([#2368](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2368))
- `git hack` no longer has the `-p` option. Use `git append` and `git prepend` instead ([#2577](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2577))
- Git Town no longer considers it an error if there is nothing to abort or continue ([#2631](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2631), [#2632](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2632))
- querying the version of the installed Git Town binary is now compatible with the way Git does it: `git-town --version` instead of `git-town version` ([#2603](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2603))
- v10 renames the `debug` parameter to `verbose` because all it does is print more information ([#2598](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2598))
- updated GitLab support, please report regressions

#### New Features

- support for running Git Town on computers that use different language than English ([#2478](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2478))
- `git undo` works for all commands now ([#2484](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2484))
- CLI output now contains requests to the code hosting API ([#2340](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2340))
- CLI output now describes changes the branch ancestry ([#2558](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2558))
- `git town switch` now displays the output of the command to switch branches ([#2602](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2602))
- environment variables now override all GitHub API operations ([#2593](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2593))
- community-contributed installation for BSD via FreshPorts ([#2553](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2553))
- less force-deleting of branches ([#2539](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2539))

#### Bug Fixes

- fix broken version number in release binaries ([#2333](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2333))
- fix crash when a configured branch parent is empty ([#2626](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2626))
- fix crash when running `set-parent` on large monorepos ([#2623](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2623))
- when deleting perennial branches, remove the ancestry information of their children ([#2540](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2540))

## 9.0.1 (2023-07-29)

Git Town should now run a bit faster because it runs fewer Git commands under the hood.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fix for missing `UpdateProposalTargetStep` ([#2288](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2288))
- Print statistics when removing aliases ([#2325](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2325))
- Fix broken version information in release binaries ([#2333](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2333))

## 9.0.0 (2023-04-07)

#### BREAKING CHANGES

Git Town 9.0 supports the new API URLs that become official in GitLab v16. If you use an older version of GitLab, Git Town's integration with GitLab's API might no longer work. The fix is to update your GitLab installation to at least v15 ([#2249](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2249))

#### New Features

- read the token to use for the GitHub API from environment variables `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` in addition to the already existing option to store it in the Git configuration ([#2217](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2217))

## 8.0.0 (2023-04-07)

Some ergonomics improvements that change existing command names, hence the major version bump. If you use the shorter aliases for Git Town commands, please run `git town aliases add` after updating to v8.0.

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- rename `new-branch-push-flag` command to `push-new-branches` ([#1980](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1980))
- all commands that display/update configuration are now subcommands of the `config` command ([#1963](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1963), [#1976](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1976))
- all commands that help install Git Town are now subcommands of the `install` command ([#1969](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1969))
- moves the default `git town completion` and `git town completions` commands under `git town install completions` ([#1969](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1969), [#1970](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1970))
- installation of the shorter command aliases changes from `git town alias true` to `git town install aliases add` and `... remove` ([#1965](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1965), [#1966](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1966), [#1968](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1968))
- renames the `push-verify` configuration option to `push-hook` ([#1989](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1989))
- automatically renames old `push-verify` configuration settings to the new `push-hook` ([#2209](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2209))
- rename `git set-parent-branch` to `git set-parent` ([#2114](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2114))
- stores the runstate in the platform-specific config directory (`~/.config`) instead of the global temp dir ([#2126](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2126))

#### New Features

- the new `git town switch` command allows switching branches via a UI that visualizes the branch hierarchy ([#2106](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2106), [#2108](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2108))
- aliases `git town diff-parent` to `git diff-parent` ([#2128](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/2128))
- accepts more formats for boolean configuration values like "true", "yes", "on", "t", "1" ([#1978](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1978), [#1979](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1979))
- configuration command to set/display the `push-hook` config setting ([#1991](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1991))

## 7.9.0 (2023-01-22)

#### New Features

- rebase feature branches against their parent branch using the new [sync-strategy option](https://www.git-town.com/preferences/sync-strategy.html) ([#1950](https://github.com/git-town/git-town/pull/1950))

## 7.1.1 (2018-04-09)

#### Bug Fixes

- strip colors from the output of git commands run internally. This caused errors if you had git configured with `color.ui=always`

## 7.1.0 (2018-04-05)

#### New Features

- automatically remove outdated configuration

## 7.0.0 (2018-04-03)

#### BREAKING CHANGES

## 2.0.0 (2016-09-18)

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- All commands now have a `town-` prefix. Example `git town-sync`. This is to prevent conflicts with `git-extras` which adds git commands by the same name and `hub` which wants you to alias git to it and adds commands by the same name.
  - Use [git aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) to remove the `town-` prefix if you would like. Run `git town alias true` to add aliases for all `git-town` commands (skips commands which would overwrite existing aliases).
