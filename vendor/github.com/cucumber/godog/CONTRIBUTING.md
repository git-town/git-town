## About to contribute?

We appreciate that. But before you do, please learn our basic rules:

* Do you have a feature request? Then don't expect it to be implemented unless
  you or someone else sends a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
* We love [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests),
  but if you don't have a test to go with it we probably won't merge it.
* Before making significant contribution consider discussing the outline of
  your solution first. This may avoid a duplication of efforts.

Please do *not* add @author tags - this project embraces collective code
ownership. If you want to know who wrote some code, look in git. When you are
done, send a [pull request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/).
If we get a pull request where an entire file is changed because of
insignificant whitespace changes we cannot see what you have changed, and your
contribution might get rejected.
