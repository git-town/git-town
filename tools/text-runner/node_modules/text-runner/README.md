TextRunner is an agile documentation tool, in particular a semantic
documentation checker. It makes documentation executable. An example is the text
you are reading right now, which is verified for correctness by TextRunner.

There are no limitations on the text that TextRunner executes/verifies. It can
read and understand (if you tell it how) any form of plain text in any human
language as well as complex data in tables, bullet point lists, and embedded
images.

#### Use cases

- **evergreen tutorials:** your documentation is always correct, whether you
  change it or the product it describes
- **[semantic versioning](http://semver.org):** know whether a product change
  affects documented behavior
- **[readme-driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html):**
  documentation is your product prototype and drives its implementation
